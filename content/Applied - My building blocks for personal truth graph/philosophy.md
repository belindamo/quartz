Philosophy encompasses all bodies of [[knowledge|knowledge]], [historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy#:~:text=Historically%2C%20philosophy%20encompassed%20all%20bodies%20of%20knowledge).

With this definition, all knowledge including [[science]] can be encompassed by philosophy. 

There are 3 broad categories that interest me:

- Chinese schools of thought
	- Confucianism
	- Taoism - Lao-Tzu
	- Mohism - Mo
	- Legalism -  
- Greek philosophy
	- Aristotle, Plato, Epictetus
- Philosophy of science
	- Francis Bacon
	- 21st century rationalism

Other ones that have cultural significance that are kind of boring to me:

- Nietzsche
- Kant
- Hume
- Zeno
