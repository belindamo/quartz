- I am a strange loop, hoefstatder
- Logic fundamentally **does not work as a premise** when there is self-referencing
	- because things can be both true and false at the same time. It's not binary
	- [russell's paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymGt7I4Yn3k), [[incompleteness theorem]], etc etc they all point to the same thing. That **logic is not a valid system when self-referencing**

question
- is a node that references itself level crossing?

- zermelo frankel set theory (and peano axioms?) ,otis an attempt to literally to be like, 'set theory but sets can't contain themselves'
- [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymGt7I4Yn3k) with his linguistics background though says predicates are super central to language. it's a word phrase that returns a true/false. "is a predicate", "is a string of words", etc. are each a predicate that is true of itself
	- so like "is true" "is false". he has some more complicated explanation but uh yeah
- "The essential business of language is to assert or deny facts" - russell
	- in this case, then the "essential business" of language is entirely paradoxical
	- so is the entire business of logic
	- and so is the foundation of human consciousness. and that of machines

What constitutes crossing a level?  a level is crossed when a set of rules that applied to one level, no long applies to another

perhaps then it is not a level but a continuous distribution
