Self-referencing occurs *way* more frequently than we really think. 

Every loop involves self-referencing.

Self-referencing behavior is what makes science, the scientific method, be impossible as a self-contained solution to retrieve the world's knowledge. (See [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem]])
