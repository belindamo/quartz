The definition of world peace should be unit-based. Thus, we may take the simplest unit based definition that most people agree with. 

World peace at minimum means that no one dies from intentional harm from another person.

then we think, why do all justice systems today so harshly punish people who kill? It is a way to stop the propagation of murder upon finding clear evidence. 
Then we can take it further...

When two cars hit head on, you’re actually incentivized to go faster to avoid dying.
How do we avoid these situations

There is no other way for peace to happen but for every node capable of hate to filter their actions such that they are non harming to others. With the assurance that every node is filtering their actions this way, one can ensure that every person is acting out of good intention. Even if bad things happen, it comes out of good intention. I don’t think peace is that bad things don’t happen, but rather that people act out of good intention.

The above is really one way of defining your values. 

The other key piece to making the execution of it work is awareness: equanimity and sensitivity.

I think peace cannot happen unless you let the past be the past and start fresh.
