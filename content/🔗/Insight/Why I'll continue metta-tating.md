Meditating is one of those things where in the past, parts of my body, including my heart of hearts, says, "yes! yes! let's do that some more" and other parts are like, "Oh but sleep...and chocolate!...and everything else but meditating!" 

So I wrote these personal reasons for why I'll continue meditating, and specifically with the practice of [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB). 

Reasons
- I'm more likely to be happy during sitting than not
- I'm more likely to be happy rest of the day if i sit
- Being happy (serotonin release) generally seems better than not for all processes involved in being a human. 
	- For insight
	- For vibrancy
- I like the people I've met sitting
