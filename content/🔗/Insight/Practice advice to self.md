I just attended this meditation retreat and it was pretty great. I came in with no expectations and came out with some magical-like, [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system) way to access certain body states. The practice comes from a Buddhist process called the [Jhanas](https://www.jhourney.io/blog/what-are-the-jhanas), but I'm agnostic and from this experience [[Why I'll continue metta-tating|I'm pretty convinced to continue this practice]].

In my own experience, I would describe the 4 distinct states that were accessed on will as:
- J1 - Tingly sensations
- J2 - Joyful love
- J3 - Peaceful love
- J4 - Still clarity

There are more states too, and every person have different experiences in each. 

Here's a guide I wrote myself for entering these states. 

## How states have been entered in the past
1. Set 1 intention. Usually something simple like "I want to surrender", "I want to bring pleasure/love to others"
2. Short breath awareness or body scan. Maybe relax tension in body while doing body scan
3. Smile however feels natural
4. Breathe in play/joy, open, breathe out relax, open. This will bring you through the states
5. Awareness to the body's pleasure
6. [6Rs](https://www.dhammasukha.org/the-6rs) when things come up
7. Surrender

## How some of these states have felt in the past
- J1 - Tingling, physical, swaying
- J2 - Clarity, joy with and for others, play as a child
- J3 - Peace, love, safety
- J4 - Bright light, still

### How the transitions between states have felt in the past
- J1 -> J2 - Background to foreground, emerges clarity
- J2 -> J3 - Love, less swaying, spherical
- J3 -> J4 - Stillness, white light

## What feels natural for me
Every body is different, and mine is particularly in tune with: 
- Awareness of the body
- Some physical movement
- Expansion aspect of expansion, pleasure, and relaxation

## Nice exercises
- Forgiveness
- Play with pleasure/expansion/relaxation and breath
- Ask the body: What would you like to tell me?

## Nice tips
- "For the effort you think it takes, 1/2 it. then 1/2 it again"
- "Tension is the body's feedback mechanism"
