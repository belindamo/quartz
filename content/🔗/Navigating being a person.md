It's tough, man. But there are some things I've found that make life easier and even deeply fun:

- Introspective practices like meditation, writing, programming
- Aerial arts
- Intellectually stimulating collaborations
- Connection with family
- Sex
- Music

Want to peer into my own experiments and/or insights with these? It's a bit embarrassing but you can see them here:
