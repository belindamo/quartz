notes: this type of project, michael says, needs to be built to prove it works. not just words. BUT i think i need first to mathematically show this is worth pursuing, before engineering.

# I. Theory
Since times predating human existence, there has been an overwhelming abundance of data, far beyond what any collective of human senses and minds could fully absorb. To say that "we've reached the limits of human memory" seems false. This has become more apparent in modern times, as we've developed various methods of data manipulation through natural language and numbers, creating vast quantities of symbolic data. We've invented techniques for rapidly transporting this data, making it seem as if it instantaneously appears on our devices.

The challenge lies in filtering what to focus on. This dilemma can be divided into two fundamental questions: How do we discern what to believe or dismiss, and how do we prioritize what to attend to from the data we accept as true? While many might consider these questions as byproducts of the Information Age, marked by smartphones and laptops, these quandaries have existed since before humans could even articulate questions through natural language.

Consequently, a pivotal question arises: **How do we process massive volumes of symbolic data, whether truthful or not, and distill it into a structure that is useful to us?**

In my opinion, such a structure must be minimally isomorphic. In other words, the system should be as effortless for a human to reference with or without the assistance of a machine. From a Taoist perspective, this structure should be in harmony with its environment, including humans as essential components. The physical foundations of symbol manipulation, including entities such as the human body, must align with the theoretical foundations of any symbolic system: mathematics.

## 1. What is the purpose of a unified global knowledge system? 
A unified global knowledge system is defined here as an integrated, comprehensive framework designed to organize, store, manage, and retrieve the subsets and parent set of all human knowledge in a way that is accessible and navigable to any human or machine.

The advantages of the proposed unified global knowledge system are multifaceted:

1. **Democratic, Empirical, and Logical Knowledge Management**: With its emphasis on observable and reproducible truth, logic and citation-based credibility, and democratic debate, the system aims to prioritize and manage knowledge in a way that is grounded in observations and logic. 
2. **Enhanced Integration Between Domains**: By interconnecting various levels of complexity and fields of knowledge, this system aims to create a more holistic and accessible repository of information, breaking down silos between different domains.
3. **Navigating Complexity with Precision**: The system's structure, especially with features like strange loops and recursive decomposability, is designed to help users navigate complex information networks more effectively, providing both depth and breadth of understanding. The system highlights interdependencies and complex relationships that might not be apparent in more linear models of knowledge organization.
4. **Adaptability**: The system is envisioned as adaptable, capable of evolving with new information and changing contexts, thereby remaining relevant.
5. **Human and Machine Accessible**: By being both human and machine reference-able, the system bridges the gap between human cognitive capabilities and computational power, making it useful for a wide range of users and applications. Humans and machines inherently have different memory and cognitive capabilities. 

In essence, this unified global knowledge system is designed to be a dynamic, interconnected, and accessible tool for managing the vast array of human knowledge, fostering deeper understanding, and aiding in the efficient and credible dissemination of information.

### Definitions 
- Level: there are different levels when unique behavior appears that distinctly was not there before (emergent behavior)
	- Therefore, level distinction will be determined completely differently for the same information that has a different value function/decision making system 

## 2. The structure of a unified global knowledge system
This system is envisioned as a formal, theoretically infinite layered structure, accommodating different levels of certainty across various locales. It proposes a unique model where uncertainty is encoded within a formal system through an additional layer of abstraction. The system identifies levels based on the relevance of properties ("meta") to a concept and necessitates localization.

Key shared traits between human and computer data structures in this schema include:

1. **Keyword-Accessible Nodes**: Nodes within the structure are accessible through specific keywords, facilitating easy navigation and retrieval.
2. **Recursive Decomposability**: The system allows for infinite higher and lower levels of detail, analogous to integer levels in mathematics, ranging from a base level to theoretically infinite levels in either direction.
3. **Version History**: Tracking changes over time, allowing for historical context and evolution understanding.
4. **Annotatable Base**: A shared foundational base that can be annotated individually, tying knowledge to personal contexts and aiding retention.
5. **Base for Multimodal Content Generation**: The system is designed as a base source for generating extensive content in various mediums like images, paraphrased text, and video. This content can subsequently be tailored based on a user's demographic profile, providing a personalized experience that aligns with individual needs and contexts. 
7. **Human Memory Techniques**: Utilization of memory techniques for efficient space usage, rapid learning, and retrieval, aligned with the forgetting curve and other memory retention strategies.
8. **Prioritization Mechanism**: A decision-making process for storing knowledge based on observable truth, credibility, and usefulness of outcomes.
9. **Inter-level Node Connectivity Leading to Strange Loops**: Nodes within the structure are not only self-contained at their respective levels but also interconnected with nodes at other levels of complexity. This interconnectivity fosters the formation of 'strange loops'—a concept wherein a node at one level can, directly or indirectly, influence or be influenced by a node at a different level. These strange loops add a layer of robustness and depth to the knowledge system, enabling complex, dynamic relationships and insights that transcend linear hierarchical structures. However, they also introduce additional layers of complexity and intricacy, demanding more sophisticated navigational and interpretative strategies.
10. **Dynamic Regeneration Based on Updated Prioritization and Content**: The system features an adaptable and dynamic structure, where the knowledge graph can be regenerated or restructured based on updated prioritization mechanisms and newly available content. It allows the system to continuously evolve, reflecting changes in what is deemed credible, true, and useful. 

Furthermore, this schema emphasizes a multi-modal approach with a text-based core as the most condensed truth source. It prioritizes knowledge grounded in science, facts from credible sources, and democratic deliberation processes. The structure is designed to be both human and computer-referencable, small enough for human memorization yet expansive for computer processing. It follows a recursive decomposition, allowing for super-classes and sub-classes within a consistent format. The proposal hints at an evergreen format, suggesting a constantly evolving and updating structure.

The system is grounded in principles of harmonious integration with both mathematical foundations and the physical realities of symbol manipulation, including the human body. It seeks to create a structure that is as seamless for human reference as it is for machine processing, so that we may be at harmony with our environment. 

## 3. Collaborating via a formal system

- This is theory corollary to II.4 decision making
- What happens after a decision is made, to maintain?
	- Does the concept of equilibrium apply?
- Inspiration is taken from: Git version control, benchmarking
- Would this collaboration method be able to substitute communication for consensus via words and body language?
- Could we achieve inference alignment across all levels? 
	- true/false system
	- probabilistically
	- language model reasons
	- language model intuition
	- human reason
	- human intuition

## 4. Strange loops, level-crossing, and other limitations of a formal system

- Strange loop
	- may involve reference and paradox

Strange loops enhance the system's capacity to mimic the complex, often non-linear nature of real-world knowledge and understanding. A strange loop allow for a more holistic and interconnected view of information, mirroring the multifaceted and interconnected reality of human cognition and the natural world. The presence of strange loops within the schema underscores the importance of careful design and navigation to manage the increased complexity effectively while harnessing the power of these intricate connections.

### What is an example of a strange loop? 

## 5. Augmenting memory of entities using different locales
- Entities: any part of the world that is capable of learning, retrieving, and retaining information in the formal system
- Different sets of entities will have different locales and levels that they look at
- Explain how information may be learned, retrieved, and retained from this formal system
- Isomorphisms of biological human memory techniques to those of other entities
	- Hopefully, one day we may reduce lossiness of isomorphisms to the point of near elimination
- Retrieval may be done via accessing through the body's senses. 
	- The most visceral experiences of retrieval will be difficult to communicate via text

### on deciding to live 
Why do we decide to live on this earth? I don’t think there is a rational reason for it because a “reason” necessitates some sort of higher level goal. But when god no longer exists and you do not believe pursuing the goals of the higher emergent levels (say, of a set of people or a larger ecosystem outside your body ), then it might be worth saying at that point, hey I am done living. Conversely, if you believe *more* that your death furthers the goals of the higher emergent levels than in your own goal to live, then that's another to choose to put your life in harm's way.

And I think that’s ok. If you want to die, then die. God doesn’t exist, at least not operating in the way described in the Bible and other religious texts, so there should be no twisted fear-based reason based on falseness. 

But I think there are a few compelling reasons to live, though I’m personally not fully convinced I think they are the most compelling so far.
One is mentioned above, about being part of a force greater than just yourself and pursuing the greater set’s objectives even at the expense of your own positive states 
The other is to live for yourself, experiencing all of the emotions and realize it’s a blessing to even have a human existence. The negative experiences - how cool to experience that? Uhhh.
The last is the notion of peace, also related to first point. The peace and alignment between levels and within a level is quite a beautiful one. Killing your self is to bring pain to the self in a disruptive and unpeaceful manner, disrupting peace/alignment

(These all feel pretty weak to me…)

## 1. No intentional physiological harm of any beings may be encoded in formal system.
- This means physical and mental harm.
- Define harm?
## 1. A being on the same level is equal.
- This applies to nonhuman beings too
- Their experiences and opinions are treated equally

## 2. It's axioms all the way down.
- Given infinite axioms and infinite levels, there are infinite ways of rearranging them. ,
- The system is based on empirical data, truthfully reported, first and foremost
	- Just because a set is infinite does not mean it does not exclude
- Consensus is secondary, to resolve uncertainty points

## 3. Maximum transparency is the path to peace.
- Necessary for collaboration
- How to define peace?
## 4. Use appropriate metrics with appropriate levels of quantitative and qualitative metrics, weighting conclusions based on uncertainty.

## 5. Differing locales and levels may inherently contradict.
- In this case, larger locale overrule smaller locale. This does not mean the person overseeing the larger lcoale is superior, but rather their locale takes precedent

## 6. No intentional killing of any beings may be encoded in formal system.

## 7. No axiom is absolute.
