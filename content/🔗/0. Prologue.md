First, what are my personal motivations for this system? 

My primary goal is to synthesize the knowledge I've accumulated over the past 25 years into a reliable and reference-able knowledge base, one that is rooted in observable physical truths.

I aim to develop a holistic knowledge and decision-making system for near-perfect storage and retrieval in human memory, while also being compatible with computer interfaces.

Thank you for taking the time to read this!
