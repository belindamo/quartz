I wanted to record my wins for 2024 since I so often become caught up in what others think or my own expectations for myself. This page is for me üòä

### April
- [Launched Viva's desktop application](https://app.vivatranslate.com/desktop)
- [Released Spotify album about Silicon Valley](https://open.spotify.com/album/5lTnz3s75vWudUv3GQdi6H?si=xqBl4TuXTfqng79nOjHxdw)
- [Hosted a hackathon at MIT](https://x.com/agihouse_org/status/1779614898382680328)
- I've continued to be on a meditation streak since Jan 1 where I meditate for at least a minute a day. I've tried multiple types of meditation, and it turns out that loving-kindness meditation (yes it's a real thing) has been [[Why I'll continue metta-tating|the one that's stuck for me]]. 
- Started picking up qi gong again
- Experiments complete
	- [[8. What does a good translation interface look like for same language "translation" across contexts? üî¥]]
	- [[9. How might a set of AI models improve code generation through iterative code and test set generation? üü¢]]
	- [[10. GPT vs. Gemini - What does a minimalistic user interface for model comparison look like? üü¢]]
- Proposals created and updated
	- [[A Knowledge Graph Structure for Enhancing Human Learning]]
	- Tweaked most of the other ones

I've decided I want to complete 100 experiments and their write-ups by the end of the year. Just got to get those reps in, ya know

## March
- I chatted with someone who runs a civil non-profit and she asked me if she could use my graph website for her non-profit work! I was so honored. I said yes, and directed her to the source code and how to use it. 
- Went to Machu Picchu. I loved staying in Cusco, Peru. There is a tremendously healing energy in the Sacred Valley. 
- [Viva Translate](https://vivatranslate.com) continues to be running well
- Concluded my brief contribution on Common Core research at Stanford. I'm excited to see the final paper results! 
- Attended a hackathon hosted by South Park Commons and OpenAI working on a note-taking interface. Turns out you can't really make a whole comprehensive note-taking interface in 2 days
- Signed up for a marathon üíÄ
- Experiment write-ups
	- [[7. How is the writing quality of GPT-4 + RAG for querying over my Obsidian notes? üî¥]]
- Proposals
	- [[Back-translation for Alignment of LLM Generation of Code, Tests, and more]]
	- [[PROPOSAL Knowledge base scaffolding for humans and computers]]
	- and others
## February

- 1 additional experiment + write-up and a few proposal drafts
	- [[6. What is it like to convert a Next.js app to PWA? üü¢]]
	- Proposals
		- [[PROPOSAL Multicomponent Systems that Self-Organize with an Information Stream]]
		- [[Crowdsourcing a Universal Browser Automation Task Graph with Continuously Running Tests]]
		- Solve math theorems using graphs
- Revamped https://justanexperiment.com so it's simpler and something I would actually use
	- [Translate page](https://justanexperiment.com/translate)
	- [Graph page](https://justanexperiment.com/graph)
- Did some consulting for [MultiON](https://multion.ai/), which is a multi-agent startup. Their product is SO cool. It took up more time than expected but it was very fun :) 
- Got my work for this Common Core research at Stanford to work fairly well. 
- Released first song ever on Spotify! It is called [Group House](https://open.spotify.com/track/1wGFRR03ZteLKNVBGEirhq?si=aacf562ff94745de), and is about living in the San Francisco group house scene. It is a meme
- Did a hackathon hosted by OpenAI and South Park Commons. We worked on connecting graph notes together. I learned a lot about new full-stack tools like [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/)
- Went on a hike with my parents and family friends. I got separated at some point and decided to play around memory techniques. 

I spent a lot of time this month catching up with family I'd been neglecting during the startup journey in the last few years. I lived with my parents in SoCal, celebrated Chinese New Year with my relatives in Los Angeles, and caught up with my cousin in San Francisco. I am always shocked how similar I am to my relatives. Our speech patterns, our cheekbones, our boisterous laughter. Patterns of guilt and shame. Body language of showing affection. Maybe it is surprising to me because I spend so much time away from family, working with people whose cultural and geographical backgrounds are so different from mine. My chest feels warm when I think of them.

## January
So much happened this month! 

- [5 experiments + write-ups complete](https://write.justanexperiment.com/)  and 14 additional proposals for future experiments
	- [[5. What does a suite of personal GPTs on ChatGPT look like for content like research proposals and social media posts? üü†]]
	- [[4. What does it look like to automating UI Improvements with GPT-Vision? üü¢]]
	- [[3. How accurate is RAG + GPT-4 for an orthopedic surgeon? üü¢]]
	- [[2. What would a knowledge graph of science look like, generated recursively entirely by GPT-4? üü¢]]
	- [[1. How do I track my hours in a way that feels good? üü†]]
	- [[0. Will I be able to build this site in 1 day, where I'll stick with it? üî¥]]
- Meditated everyday üïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è
- Used [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/) for the first time to help my brother build [a RAG application for Orthopedics](https://write.justanexperiment.com/3)
- Experimented with Midjourney and created a cute Insta influencer with orange hair ([5 followers :D](https://www.instagram.com/orangecountygirlai) )
- Interviewed at a big tech company and a seed-stage AI startup. I feel honored that they were both direct referrals that I didn't seek out, and that they were interested in me üòå
- [Won 2nd place at a hackathon](https://x.com/MatthewHeartful/status/1749289252498866578?s=20) for a [[4. What does it look like to automating UI Improvements with GPT-Vision? üü¢|heatmap-to-frontend-code tool]]
- [[2. What would a knowledge graph of science look like, generated recursively entirely by GPT-4? üü¢|Assembled a few knowledge graphs]]
- Had a temporary obsession with [Vercel's](https://vercel.com/) developer ecosystem. I was able to get [this multi-tenant application](https://write.justanexperiment.com/) up and running in an hour with one of their templates. Still not totally over it yet.
- My startup [Viva Translate](https://www.vivatranslate.com/) is running well. They have their Microsoft Teams integration in development, plus some very cool generative AI features. So grateful for this team. Maybe we should rename ourselves to Universal Translator...
- Conducted an analysis over my [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/) notes using LlamaIndex. Couldn't find much use for Q&A flow with my notes yet, unfortunately
- Created 4 custom GPTs using [OpenAI's consumer interface](https://chat.openai.com/gpts). I chat with them about half with voice and half with text. I use them to create proposals and online posts - very helpful!
- Attended a lovely gathering at Replit headquarters called Playspace. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many friends that I've gotten to know over the past 2 years post-pandemic
- Started working part-time with [AGIHouse](https://agihouse.org/)  to help build their open source AI applications and documentation
- Started research part-time at Stanford on reliably generating Common Core math problems 
- Cool and very fun collaboration with some folks on agentic systems
- Used GPT-4 + Whisper in OpenAI's consumer app to review this month's reflection, and wow it was better than my last therapist at giving advice lol. Completely out-of-the-box too! (no system prompt)

ü•µ I remind myself daily to slow down, because  I feel my tendency is to move too fast.  I suppose when you're having a good time, you can get wild amounts of stuff done! There are also a lot of open threads too, and I remind myself that it's ok to be in the 'explore' phase, as long as I am fulfilling my commitments to others.
