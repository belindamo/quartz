I wanted to record my wins for 2024 since I so often become caught up in what others think or my own expectations for myself. I'd like to dedicate this page to what I've been able to do 😊

## February
(in progress)
- X experiments + write-ups complete
- Went on a hike with my parents and family friends. I got separated at some point and decided to play around with some memory techniques. 

## January
So much happened this month! 

- [5 experiments + write-ups complete](https://write.justanexperiment.com/)  and 14 additional proposals for future experiments
	- [[5. Custom GPTs for cross-posting 🟠]]
	- [[4. From heat-map to front-end code 🟢]]
	- [[3. RAG for an orthopedic surgeon 🟢]]
	- [[2. Science knowledge graph 🟢]]
	- [[1. Hour tracking 🟠]]
	- [[0. Sticking with 1 site 🔴]]
- Meditated everyday 🕊️🕊️🕊️
- Used [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/) for the first time to help my brother build [a RAG application for Orthopedics](https://write.justanexperiment.com/3)
- Experimented with Midjourney and created a cute Insta influencer with orange hair ([5 followers :D](https://www.instagram.com/orangecountygirlai) )
- Interviewed at a big tech company and a seed-stage agents startup. I feel honored that they were both direct referrals that I didn't seek out, and that they were interested in me 😌
- [Won 2nd place at a hackathon](https://x.com/MatthewHeartful/status/1749289252498866578?s=20) for a [[4. From heat-map to front-end code 🟢|heatmap-to-frontend-code tool]]
- [[2. Science knowledge graph 🟢|Assembled a few knowledge graphs]]
- Had a temporary OBSESSION with [Vercel's](https://vercel.com/) developer ecosystem. I was able to get [this multi-tenant application](https://write.justanexperiment.com/) up and running in an hour with one of their templates. Still not totally over it yet.
- My last startup [Viva Translate](https://www.vivatranslate.com/) is running well. They have their Microsoft Teams integration in development, plus some very cool generative AI features. So grateful for this team. Maybe we should rename ourselves to Universal Translator...
- Conducted an analysis over my [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/) notes using LlamaIndex. Couldn't find much use for Q&A flow with my notes yet, unfortunately
- Created 4 custom GPTs using [OpenAI's consumer interface](https://chat.openai.com/gpts). I chat with them about half with voice and half with text. I use them to create proposals and online posts - very helpful!
- Attended a lovely gathering at Replit headquarters called Playspace. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many friends that I've gotten to know over the past 2 years post-pandemic
- Started working part-time with [AGIHouse](https://agihouse.org/)  to help build their open source AI applications and documentation
- Started research part-time at Stanford on reliably generating Common Core math problems 
- Cool and very fun collaboration with some folks on agentic systems
- Used GPT-4 + Whisper in OpenAI's consumer app to review this month's reflection, and wow it was better than my last therapist at giving advice lol. Completely out-of-the-box too! (no system prompt)

🥵 I remind myself daily to slow down, because  I feel my tendency is to move too fast.  I suppose when you're having a good time, you can get wild amounts of stuff done! There are also a lot of open threads too, and I remind myself that it's ok to be in the 'explore' phase, as long as I am fulfilling my commitments to others.
