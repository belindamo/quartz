All problems that a human being can solve can be reduced to a set of algorithms, supporting the idea that machine and human intelligence are essentially equivalent. 
(And +1 for machine computation too, really) 
(Kurzweil, spiritual machines, 268)

Any real world computation can be translated into an equivalent computation involving a Turing machine
