To review
- a [[Pattern language]] corresponds problems to  proposals
- Writing is already a method of explainability

Both the difficulty and beauty with natural language is how interpretable it is. A number is exact whereas a word has multiple meanings based on context. 
# Purpose of such a language
To pursue this, perhaps we must first understand what the purpose of such a language is.

As Wittgenstein mentioned, perhaps the purpose of any language is to elucidate one's thoughts. Language also has the obvious purpose of communication between entities. 

I think this language does its job sufficiently if:
- it can be used to build airtight arguments. 
- it can be used as an intermediary language to verify arguments.

(todo: add these to the grammar notes)
An [[axiomatic language]] that is logically coherent, global, and efficient, and therefore a more human and machine understandable language

**Question: How might we move up the hierarchy of formal languages, post transformer boom?** 

3, ie. regular languages or [[regular grammar]], are all language that can be decided by a finite state automaton 
2, ie. context free languages or [[context-free grammar]], are the theoretical basis for most programming languages 
My sense is there is some way LLMs enable us to move up the hierarchy to 0, a language that is recursively enumerable, thus covering a wider problem space 

Criteria
- Phonetically based
- a first order logic language 
	- Maybe second onwards too?
- Compatible with a recursively enumerable programming language

	- Lojban 
		- While the initial aim of the Loglan project was to investigate [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Linguistic_relativity "Linguistic relativity"), the active Lojban community recognizes additional applications for the language, including:
			- Improved human–human communication, due to the logical and unambiguous structure and greater means of expression (use as a speakable language)
			- Eliminating syntactic ambiguity in language
			- Use as an [educational tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Education "Education")
			- Research in [artificial intelligence and machine understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence")
			- Improved human–computer communication, [storage ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Ontology_(information_science) "Ontology (information science)"), and [computer translation of natural language text](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Machine_translation "Machine translation")
			- Research in [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Linguistics "Linguistics")
			- Use as an academic language, such as in science or philosophy

have a secret code that is typing in the American alphabet but switching the keyboard to numbers instead

How might we have language that is consistent? 

- A language that is accessible from both human-human, human-computer, and computer-computer interaction

look at
- lambda calculus
- a pattern language, cristopher alexander
- Regex

I wonder if a comparative difference in speed would be trackable between a human store and computer store. E.g. it is computationally expensive 

Recursion is memory and computationally expensive because you have to add function to stack every iteration, as opposed to an iterator 
It can do multi plan exploration though that an iterator cannot
