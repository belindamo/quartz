Welcome to a kickoff of a series of experiments! Today, we're diving into a conundrum that many of us face in the digital age - the struggle to stick with a personal project. Countless times, I've started a blog or a personal website, full of enthusiasm, only to see it fizzle out after a few weeks or months. ðŸ™ˆ The question we're exploring here is whether a change in approach can make a difference. Can multi-tenancy help us break the cycle of starting and abandoning personal websites? Let's find out.

## **Introduction**

I've been guilty of bouncing between different types of websites and never quite committing to one. In the past, my experiments and writings were hosted on individual sites, making it inconvenient to manage and share my work effectively. This time, I've decided to take a different path.

This latest attempt at a personal site isÂ [multi-tenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy), which means I can programmatically assign custom domains, subdomains, and SSL certificates to users. In other words, this will allow me to host my personal experiments in the same place as my blog posts. Not only that, but it will make it easier for anyone interested to try out these experiments.

## **Past Works**

To give you some context, my past websites have all followed the same pattern - they start with enthusiasm and promise but eventually get taken down due to a lack of upkeep or focus. Some of those websites were also deployed using Next.js and Vercel, so the primary change here is the multi-tenancy nature of this site template.

For this experiment, I found inspiration in theÂ [Platform Starter Kit by Vercel](https://demo.vercel.pub/). Vercel's tools and platform seemed like the perfect fit for my experiment, since they handle free deployment and database hosting for individual developers like myself.

## **Plan**

### **Evaluation**

Now, let's outline the plan. I'll stick with this Vercel-based site for a month. At two points, I'll evaluate this plan based on two simple criteria:

1. Does this template feel good to me by the end of the day?
2. In one month, am I still building on top of this Platform Starter Kit template?

### **Implications**

This experiment has its limitations. It's not just about the template; I also have more time now compared to my previous attempts. So, even if the experiment passes, I can't attribute all the success solely to the template. However, I can confidently say that the template plays a crucial role, and if this experiment passes, it proves that it's sufficient.

## **Results: Fail ðŸ”´**

### Day of completing experiment: Pass ðŸŸ¢

Did this experiment pass or fail the first check? Well, I'm happy to report that it's a pass! The template feels great, and the application looks slick. Anyone can create an account yourself too to see the web app itself.

### 1 month in: Fail ðŸ”´

Checking in again a month later in February, I've decided to move away from the site I started with. I was already using an open source site builder with Obsidian called [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and have decided it's better to simplify and have all my writing in one site. 

I also ran into many problems with this multi-tenant site with loading speed, dark mode, and the post publishing flow. It looks cool off the bat but I ran into many problems that I didn't feel like fixing...so I've reverted to simplifying my flows and good ol' open source templates. 

## **What did I learn?**

Through this experiment, I've learned how amazing Vercel is for deploying websites quickly. It took me approximately 8 hours to set up, including some tweaks to make it look just right for me. From an engineering perspective, I also delved into the world of multi-tenant websites, where you can programmatically add subdomains and SSL. It's been an enlightening experience.

So, there you have it. Can a change in approach and a user-friendly template make a difference in sticking with a personal website? The answer, at least in my case, was a no for this time around. That being said, I'm optimistic about this other site! Let's hope it sticks
