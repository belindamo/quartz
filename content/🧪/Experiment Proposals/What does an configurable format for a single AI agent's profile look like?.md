# Summary

This project aims to develop a YAML-based AI agent configuration template that enhances transparency and comprehensibility for non-technical users. 

The template will (1) providing configuration fields that are corollaries to familiar human parameters like "Car License Plate" or "Family history of illness" and (2) simplify complex techniques like multi-agent orchestration or chain-of-thought prompting in a single configuration field.

Hopefully, this will make AI more accessible and steerable to a broader audience.

# Related Work

The project builds on established practices in structured data and dynamic system updates. It draws inspiration from the use of structured formats like the frontmatter of Markdown files in tools such as Obsidian, and Michael Bernstein's research on Automative Simulacra that used dynamic system prompts to direct NPC behavior in a virtual environment, emphasizing the value of precise, real-time data updates for improving AI interaction accuracy and utility.

# Risks

The main risk is the potential failure of the YAML template to significantly improve AI agent performance, which could limit its practical utility. This outcome would indicate that even a user-friendly and transparent configuration might not translate into better operational results.

# Questions for Experiments That Will De-risk the Project

1. Does the YAML configuration improve AI agent task completion rates compared to traditional configurations? Or are there other formats? 
2. What fields in the YAML template significantly influence agent performance and user comprehension?
3. Does the YAML template's effectiveness vary across different AI applications, such as those dealing with sensitive information versus general tasks?

# Evaluation

We will evaluate the YAML configuration by comparing the performance of AI agents using this template, versus using a simple system prompt or no prompt at all. 

The primary metrics will be task success rate and automation effectiveness, focusing on structured system prompts in various scenarios. This evaluation will also identify which aspects of the YAML contribute most to performance improvements, providing detailed insights into the template's efficacy.
