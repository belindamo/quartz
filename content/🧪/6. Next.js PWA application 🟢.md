What is it like to convert a Next.js app to PWA?

## Experiment Length:
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours  
**Actual Time:** 3 hours

## Summary:
I recently decided to convert a Next.js app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) using the Serwist library. My aim was to see if I could achieve a unified codebase that would work across different platforms, combining the strengths of web and mobile development. The process involved integrating essential PWA features such as a `manifest.json`, service worker, and storage modules into a Next.js app that uses Tailwind CSS for its UI components.

## Plan:
My plan was straightforward. I took my existing Next.js app and began adding PWA functionalities to it. This meant:
- Adding a `manifest.json` file so the app could be installed on device home screens.
- Implementing a service worker for offline functionality and caching.
- Integrating storage solutions to enhance the app's performance and user experience.
- Testing the app on iOS devices to ensure it could run as a standalone application without showing the browser bar.

## Result:  ðŸŸ¢ Pass
The experiment was successful. The PWA library integrated well with the Next.js app, allowing it to be added to a mobile home screen as intended. There was a minor issue with the manifest JSON on desktops, particularly with the size of the thumbnails, but it was a small problem that could be easily fixed. The app's deployment through Vercel showed good performance, indicating that the conversion worked as planned.

## What I Learned:
This experiment taught me quite a bit about converting a Next.js app into a PWA and the potential of PWAs for cross-platform development. I was initially unsure about how well a PWA could replicate a native app experience, but the positive outcome of this experiment has made me more open to the idea. I'm now interested in exploring further PWA features, such as caching, background tasks, and notifications, to understand their full potential in providing a seamless user experience across different platforms.
