title: Personal GPT with Obsidian notes
---
## Experiment Length:
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Actual Time:** 1 hour

## Summary:
In this experiment, I tackled the problem of the time-consuming process of manually rereading and reflecting on personal notes. I attempted to use AI to enhance the efficiency of retrieving information to improve my writing, specifically through the integration of Obsidian notes with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), supported by GPT-4 embeddings via [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai/)'s framework. I generated a graph based on a series of my notes based on the [Evergreen](evergreen notes) format.

More info towards the end! 
## Plan:
The plan was to organize messy and vast numbers of personal notes. By embedding Obsidian notes with a RAG system, the goal was to facilitate AI-enhanced querying, making the reflection process more intuitive and less time-consuming. This involved using RAG with GPT embeddings to sift through the information seamlessly. 

The evaluation plan was structured around an independent variable (IV) of using RAG for writing versus manual writing methods, with a dependent variable (DV) being my personal gauge of improved organization, accuracy of notes to the source material, ability to add more accurate context in addition to the source material, and reflection satisfaction.

## Results: 🔴 Fail
Despite the straightforward implementation of RAG, the solution fell short of expectations primarily due to subpar result quality. Part of this was because my notes were pretty disorganized. The evaluation revealed that RAG along had limited effectiveness in enhancing personal reflection through Obsidian notes, marking the experiment as unsuccessful in achieving its intended outcomes.

## What I Learned:
Firstly, the rapid setup of Llama Index applications was awesome - it took about 30 minutes total to get it working. 

However, the importance of an intuitive user interface became evident, as the reliance on a terminal proved to be cumbersome and detracted from my process of reflection and learning. I think this reflection may be better suited via for voice interaction or integration within existing note-taking and reflection practices, such as within Obsidian. These would be more seamless experiences, integrated within familiar tools, and therefore more effective in enhancing personal reflection and note querying processes.

# Art and Science: A Symbiotic Relationship

Art and science share a symbiotic relationship, each influencing and enriching the other [[Creative Processes for the 21st Century]]. Art, with its emphasis on creativity and expression, provides a unique perspective that inspires scientific inquiry and pushes the boundaries of knowledge [[Concept: The Core of Personal Truth]]. Science, on the other hand, offers a systematic and evidence-based approach that enhances the understanding and interpretation of artistic concepts [[Science Belief as a Knowledge Foundation]].

The interplay between art and science can be seen throughout history, from the Renaissance period where artists like Leonardo da Vinci combined artistic skill with scientific observation, to modern times where technology and scientific advancements have opened new avenues for artistic expression [[The Essence of Prologues]]. Artists often draw inspiration from scientific concepts, using them as a foundation to explore and communicate complex ideas [[Unifying Knowledge Systems]].

In turn, art has the power to communicate scientific concepts to a broader audience, making them more accessible and engaging [[Decision-Making Systems Personalized]]. Through visual representations, music, and other artistic mediums, complex scientific ideas can be simplified and conveyed in a way that resonates with people [[Languages: Axiomatic, Natural, and Patterned]].

The symbiotic relationship between art and science extends beyond the creative process. Art can also contribute to scientific research by providing new perspectives and insights. Artists often collaborate with scientists, bringing their unique perspectives and approaches to scientific projects [[Collaborative Truth-Seeking Across Entities]]. This interdisciplinary collaboration fosters innovation and pushes the boundaries of both art and science [[Innovating Research Through Novel Approaches]].

In conclusion, art and science are deeply interconnected, with each discipline enriching and influencing the other. The collaboration between artists and scientists leads to new discoveries, enhances understanding, and fosters creativity [[Art and Science: A Symbiotic Relationship]]. By embracing this symbiotic relationship, we can unlock new possibilities and deepen our understanding of the world around us [[Proposing a Unified Knowledge System]].

2. The structure of a unified global knowledge system

This system is envisioned as a formal, theoretically infinite layered structure, accommodating different levels of certainty across various locales. It proposes a unique model where uncertainty is encoded within a formal system through an additional layer of abstraction. The system identifies levels based on the relevance of properties ("meta") to a concept and necessitates localization.

Key shared traits between human and computer data structures in this schema include:

1. **Keyword-Accessible Nodes**: Nodes within the structure are accessible through specific keywords, facilitating easy navigation and retrieval.

2. **Recursive Decomposability**: The system allows for infinite higher and lower levels of detail, analogous to integer levels in mathematics, ranging from a base level to theoretically infinite levels in either direction.

3. **Version History**: Tracking changes over time, allowing for historical context and evolution understanding.

4. **Annotatable Base**: A shared foundational base that can be annotated individually, tying knowledge to personal contexts and aiding retention.

5. **Base for Multimodal Content Generation**: The system is designed as a base source for generating extensive content in various mediums like images, paraphrased text, and video.

Source 2:

This content can subsequently be tailored based on a user's demographic profile, providing a personalized experience that aligns with individual needs and contexts.

7. **Human Memory Techniques**: Utilization of memory techniques for efficient space usage, rapid learning, and retrieval, aligned with the forgetting curve and other memory retention strategies.

8. **Prioritization Mechanism**: A decision-making process for storing knowledge based on observable truth, credibility, and usefulness of outcomes.

9. **Inter-level Node Connectivity Leading to Strange Loops**: Nodes within the structure are not only self-contained at their respective levels but also interconnected with nodes at other levels of complexity. This interconnectivity fosters the formation of 'strange loops'—a concept wherein a node at one level can, directly or indirectly, influence or be influenced by a node at a different level. These strange loops add a layer of robustness and depth to the knowledge system, enabling complex, dynamic relationships and insights that transcend linear hierarchical structures. However, they also introduce additional layers of complexity and intricacy, demanding more sophisticated navigational and interpretative strategies.

Source 3:

10. **Dynamic Regeneration Based on Updated Prioritization and Content**: The system features an adaptable and dynamic structure, where the knowledge graph can be regenerated or restructured based on updated prioritization mechanisms and newly available content. It allows the system to continuously evolve, reflecting changes in what is deemed credible, true, and useful.

Furthermore, this schema emphasizes a multi-modal approach with a text-based core as the most condensed truth source. It prioritizes knowledge grounded in science, facts from credible sources, and democratic deliberation processes. The structure is designed to be both human and computer-referencable, small enough for human memorization yet expansive for computer processing. It follows a recursive decomposition, allowing for super-classes and sub-classes within a consistent format. The proposal hints at an evergreen format, suggesting a constantly evolving and updating structure.

The system is grounded in principles of harmonious integration with both mathematical foundations and the physical realities of symbol manipulation, including the human body. It seeks to create a structure that is as seamless for human reference as it is for machine processing, so that we may be at harmony with our environment.

_Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: [[Most people take only transient notes]]. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: [[“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]]. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]].

  

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

  

- [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]

- [[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]

- [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]

- [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]

- [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]
