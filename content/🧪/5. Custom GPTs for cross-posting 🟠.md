What does a suite of personal GPTs on ChatGPT look like to help generate content like research proposals and social media posts?

## Experiment Length:

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours  
**Actual Time:** Approximately 2 hours

## Summary:

In this experiment, I explored the potential of using a suite of personal GPTs on ChatGPT to assist in generating various types of content, such as research proposals and social media posts. The aim was to streamline the content creation process, making it less time-consuming and more motivating. By leveraging personal GPTs, I hoped to adopt a source-to-distribution approach for content creation, moving away from the traditional method of generating code to directly writing content.

## Plan:

The plan involved several key steps:

- **Utilizing Personal GPTs:** Employing the recently released personal GPTs from the OpenAI store to create specialized GPTs tailored for content generation tasks.
- **Content Generation:** Using the personal GPT and its creator module to assist in writing posts from research proposals, effectively duplicating my knowledge-work capabilities.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality of the content generated by the personal GPTs to determine their effectiveness and potential for continued use.

## Result: ðŸŸ  Fail and Pass?

The initial output quality from the generated personal GPT assistant was deemed a failure due to it being subpar; it contained excessive fluff and required significant editing, approximately 80% of the content needed revisions. 

However, when evaluating the utility in generating proposals, it was a pass as the GPT significantly increased productivity. With this method, I was able to create around 15 proposals in a single day, a stark contrast to managing just one without the assistance of the personal GPT. I also still use it, so I would count that as a win :)

## What I Learned:

Despite the underwhelming quality of auto-generated content by the agent, the experiment shed light on the significant benefits of using an AI agent for material generation. The use of a personal GPT for content generation proved to be highly beneficial, leading to a considerable increase in productivity. With this method, I was able to create around 15 proposals in a single day, a stark contrast to managing just one without the assistance of the personal GPT. This experiment highlighted the importance of refining AI-generated content but underscored the utility of AI in enhancing productivity for knowledge-work tasks.
