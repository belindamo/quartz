**Title**: Analyzing the Efficiency of OpenAI/evals for Math Olympiad Problem Responses

**Objective**:  
The main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of using OpenAI/evals to process and respond to Math Olympiad problems. These problems, typically presented at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), often require single, precise answers such as "yes/no" or a numerical response.

**Background**:  
OpenAI/evals provides a structured framework for evaluating model responses across various dimensions. Responses are categorized as basic or complex, depending on the evaluation method required:
- **Basic evals** demand responses that are exact, include, or are fuzzy matches to the ideal response.
- **Complex evals** involve programmatic manipulation of response data, reference external datasets, or use evaluations conducted by another language model.

**Methodology**:  
1. **Selection of Problems**: A selection of math Olympiad problems from official IMO problem sheets will be used. These problems are chosen due to their objective nature and clear, single-response answers.
2. **Submission**: We will submit a Pull Request (PR) to OpenAI/evals containing the chosen IMO problems.
3. **Response Handling**: Set up response categories within the OpenAI/evals framework to appropriately process and evaluate the responses as basic evals due to their straightforward nature.
4. **Evaluation**: After the responses are generated, they will be evaluated for accuracy and precision. This evaluation will focus on the response match to the expected answer (exact, include, or fuzzy).
5. **Assessment of Outcomes**: Analyze the outcomes to determine the effectiveness of using OpenAI/evals for this type of problem. This includes measuring accuracy rates and identifying any patterns in response errors.

**Expected Outcomes**:  
- Determine the accuracy of OpenAI's language models in solving precise mathematical problems.
- Establish benchmarks for response accuracy using the basic evals framework.
- Provide insights into potential improvements in response handling for math-based queries in OpenAI/evals.

**Significance**:  
This experiment will provide valuable insights into the capabilities of OpenAI/evals in processing precise, objective responses required for mathematical problems. It could lead to more robust mechanisms for handling educational content and objective answers, improving the overall utility of language models in educational applications.
