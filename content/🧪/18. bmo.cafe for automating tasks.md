**Title**: What does a cute little cafe called bmo.cafe look like that helps you get your tasks done?


Developing a cafe-like tool for automating tasks using natural language queries and AI.
- [Speaker 1 aims to create a simple, task-oriented solution for scheduling tasks with AI using Python and cron.](https://otter.ai/u/kU5mAFKvcY8IXW-jD8Ze2cLZt0c?tab=chat&t=9s&view=transcript)
- [Speaker 1 explores using a "streaming like a stream, thought stream memory stream" for each agent, but settles on generating scripts with language models and testing them in a cafe.](https://otter.ai/u/kU5mAFKvcY8IXW-jD8Ze2cLZt0c?tab=chat&t=150s&view=transcript)
- [Speaker 1 plans to integrate dream coder aspects into People Cafe, including a library built over time with user-specified tasks.](https://otter.ai/u/kU5mAFKvcY8IXW-jD8Ze2cLZt0c?tab=chat&t=300s&view=transcript)
- [Speaker 1 discusses using natural language queries to generate tasks and the potential for autonomous software systems.](https://otter.ai/u/kU5mAFKvcY8IXW-jD8Ze2cLZt0c?tab=chat&t=481s&view=transcript)


**Problem**: There is no cute and user-friendly way to run automated tasks in the background. Existing options like cron jobs and AI agents like AgentGPT and Multion have clunky interfaces and lack appeal, especially from a non-tech perspective. The goal is to make AI agents cute and appealing.

**Bit**: Currently, existing solutions for running automated tasks include cron jobs and AI agents like AgentGPT and Multion, which have clunky and non-appealing interfaces.

**Flip**: This experiment will introduce a cute and engaging interface for automated tasks, designed as an 8-bit/16-bit pixel art setting, resembling a cute little cafe where tasks are visualized in a charming and user-friendly manner.

**Instantiate solution**: The solution involves creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface where agents are represented by cute sprites and interact in an 8-bit pixel art environment, making automated tasks more engaging.

**Method**: The experiment will be conducted using Phaser, TypeScript, and JavaScript to create the interface. The front end will be developed with HTML5 and possibly React for rendering the game component. Agents will have cute sprites and interactions will be displayed through pop-up screens, similar to an 8-bit video game.

**Evaluation**: The experiment will be considered successful if the interface feels good to use and becomes a tool that you

regularly use for managing automated tasks.

**Implications**: If the experiment is successful, it demonstrates that a cute and engaging interface can make managing automated tasks more enjoyable. This could lead to broader adoption of similar user-friendly interfaces for technical tasks.

**Related works**: This experiment draws inspiration from several sources, including the Automatic Simulacra paper, AgentGPT, AGI, PrivateGPT, and LocalGPT for local storage solutions. Obsidian serves as an inspiration for user-friendliness. Additionally, the experiment is influenced by mobile games from the late 2000s to early 2010s, Stardew Valley, and MapleStory for their charming and engaging interfaces.

**Eval plan**:

- **DV (Dependent Variable)**: Personal satisfaction and engagement, measured by your own feedback and frequency of use.
- **IV (Independent Variable)**: The cuteness and design of the interface.
- **Task**: You will interact with the interface to manage automated tasks and provide personal feedback on the experience.
- **Threats**: Potential threats include personal bias and technical challenges in implementing the interface
