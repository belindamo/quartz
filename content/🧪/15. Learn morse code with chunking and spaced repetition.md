- Question - How can we evaluate the effectiveness of spaced repetition and chunking in learning Morse code?
- Context - Learning Morse code efficiently can be a challenging task. Spaced repetition (SR) and chunking strategies have shown promise in various learning domains for enhancing retention and speeding up the learning process. I aimed to explore the effectiveness of these strategies in learning Morse code.
- Answer - The use of chunking for learning Morse code proved to be helpful. By combining images, spaced repetition, and chunking, the learning and retention process were significantly expedited.
	- The Morse code for a-z and 0-9 was memorized in 40 minutes! 
- Primarily for personal learning or novel discovery? - Personal learning
- What is the [[delta]]? - The delta would be the difference in the time taken to initially learn Morse code, accuracy in short-term recall, and retention after a few days and several months. 


**Method**
The experiment involved the use of a tablet to write a pangram and numbers, then adding the dots and dashes onto the drawing in blue marker. I used a tablet to write “THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG”; as a pangram, it contains all letters of the alphabet. Spaced repetition flash cards were generated with an Obsidian ChatGPT plugin, and images of each word and number chunk were added. This combination of methods resulted in a significant time saving.

Here is how I chunked:

**Future considerations**
- [Doing this with multiple participants and a control group]( https://chatgpt.com/c/7cbbf977-7d59-4946-849d-98d4d70ed347)
- Measure amount of time spent on the spaced repetition recall component. Work in progress with [[Quantified learning]]
