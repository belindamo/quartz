problem: Managing effective posting across multiple social media channels is complex due to the need for content adaptation to each platform's unique environment and audience preferences.
bit: The current process involves manually adapting and posting source material to fit the specific requirements and audience of each social media channel.
flip: The experiment posits that it's possible to automate the adaptation of source content into suitable formats for various social media platforms, starting with text-based content for Twitter and LinkedIn.
instantiate solution: Develop a system that automatically converts source material into appropriately formatted content for Twitter and LinkedIn, with plans to expand to visual platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
method: Convert the markdown format of the experiment into the standard format for social media posts using the LinkedIn and Twitter APIs to automate posting.
evaluation: Success is measured by the ability to automatically post the adapted content to Twitter and LinkedIn without manual intervention.
implications: The automation of social media posting could significantly reduce the manual effort involved, allowing for more efficient content distribution. However, there's a risk of generating and posting insensitive or inappropriate content, suggesting the need for a review mechanism before posts go live.
related works: 
  - Typefully and Hootsuite, though they require manual content input, are similar tools. The concept of converting source material into multiple target formats for social media is a novel approach not widely seen in existing solutions.
  - Current GPT Assistance: The current system used for generating destination materials.
  - Browser Automation Project: An existing project that uses AI to automate browser actions, potentially relevant for posting if API options are not feasible.
eval plan: 
  - IV: Method of generation (GPT-4 model) and post automation, posting schedule automation.
  - DV: Posting frequency, comfort level with posting, and time saved across multiple channels.
  - Task: Generate engaging content from source material using GPT-4, and automate the distribution to Twitter and LinkedIn. Explore API capabilities for posting and, if necessary, consider browser automation as an alternative.
  - Threats: The main challenge is the feasibility of automating posts through the Twitter and LinkedIn APIs. If API posting is not viable, browser automation might be required, which complicates the process.
