est. time: 2 hours for setup and conducting a meditation session.
actual time: 
problem: Difficulty in deterministically entering and measuring flow states using EEG with Neurosity.
bit: Personal experience with meditation without measuring flow states using EEG.
flip: Measuring EEG during meditation.
instantiate solution: Using the Neurosity headset with 8 channels to measure EEG during meditation sessions.
method: Conducting a single session experiment measuring EEG with Neurosity headset, with plans for future extended experiments.
evaluation: Analyzing channel information from Neurosity headset to assess increase in ability to enter flow state during the session.
implications: Personal enhancement of day-to-day activities using a headset for flow state entry and future potential for manipulating EEG data to measure other states like Jhanic states.
related works: Neurosity SDK & Research paper involving Lee Breisington on focus states across the Jhanas.
eval plan: |-
  - DV: Ability to deterministically enter a flow state.
  - IV: Using the Neurosity headset versus not using it.
  - Task: Conducting a meditation session with the headset.
  - Threats: Potential distractions preventing the completion of the session.

- i supppose i have a question about what type of affective states i'd want to actually access! like i don't want to go insane 
	- i want to be generally more:  stable throughout the day, kind, balanced/even handed, *energetic*, *happy*, *confident* like when i was a kid. like when i was a kid
	- be able to access specific states throughout the day: high equanimity (like the stone), fast logical / decision making, high compassion, make rapid associations aka creativity, fast tactical/strategic thinking, specific memory palaces, persuasive speaking/body language, relaxation
		- some may require more energy/time to activate
	- idea: can these be induced by sound? most simply it could be a specific frequency (Hz). it could be some pattern of sound or filter too.
