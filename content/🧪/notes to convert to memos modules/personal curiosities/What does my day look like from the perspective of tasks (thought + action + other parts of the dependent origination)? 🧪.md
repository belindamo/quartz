est. time: 1 hour
actual time: 
problem: Understanding atomically what tasks I'm doing that could theoretically be replaced by software, especially from the perspective of dependent origination, breaking down each task into components to understand their interdependent origins.
bit: Current task execution relies heavily on manual effort without clear understanding of their dependent origination.
flip: Transition to a system where tasks are broken down by their dependent origination for potential automation.
instantiate solution: Develop a framework to analyze daily tasks in terms of dependent origination, identifying automatable components.
method: Talk to a GPT to discuss daily tasks, creating a list of tasks with time stamps and estimated durations. Then, with the language model's help, break down each task into components based on dependent origination.
evaluation: Fact-check the listed tasks personally to confirm their accuracy and rely on personal intuition for the evaluation of the dependent origination breakdown.
implications: This work serves as a foundation to identify tasks that can be automated by AI, extending beyond the capabilities of earlier software.
related works: None applicable, as this is a unique thought experiment.
eval plan: "IV: Writing down tasks instead of just performing them. DV: Gaining a clearer understanding of the day from a task perspective. Task: Creating the list of daily tasks. Threats: Inadequate granularity in breaking down tasks or overlooking routine tasks. Mitigation involves thoughtful and thorough analysis."
findings: To be completed post-experiment
pass/fail?: To be decided post-experiment
what did I learn?: To be reflected upon post-experiment

another thought: what do my actions look like from the perspective of dependent origination?
