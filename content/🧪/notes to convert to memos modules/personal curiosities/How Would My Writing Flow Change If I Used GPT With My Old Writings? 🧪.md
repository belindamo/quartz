flip: Utilizing GPT to mimic the style of previous writings and assist in brainstorming could streamline the writing process.
instantiate solution: " Experiment with four approaches: 1) Interacting directly with ChatGPT, 2) Integrating GPT or another model via an Obsidian plug-in for writing assistance, 3) Using the embeddings plug-in in Obsidian for detailed retrieval of previous writings, and 4) Testing Notion as an additional writing interface."
method: Utilize GPT-4 for all three experimental approaches due to its proven effectiveness.
evaluation: Success will be measured by a reduction in writing friction and maintenance or improvement in writing quality.
implications: Enhancing personal writing flow with potential benefits for others seeking similar improvements, contributing to ongoing advancements in writing quality.
related works: Experiences with Lex.page highlighted the need for more interactive AI writing assistance. Notion was found to be less efficient due to its interface requiring too many clicks for desired actions.
eval plan: IV - Integration method of AI into the writing process. DV - Fluidity of the writing process and final quality of writing. Task - Experimentation with various AI-assisted writing interfaces. Threats - Potential generic responses from the AI model or inadequate outputs.
