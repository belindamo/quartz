problem: It's difficult to do multimodal memorization now that we rely on external aids, and a lot of the multimodal art of memory has been lost.
bit: There are tools like Sketchy that pre-generate images for specific domains like medicine.
flip: Images will be generated with AI for specific domains.
instantiate solution: Use stable diffusion based on a series of nodes and on their keywords.
method: 
  - Generate a background scene based on the whole context of the graph.
  - Generate an image for each node based on the keyword.
  - Create a story for images in the background scene.
  - Place images in the correct place for the story.
evaluation: Convenient to use and I continue to use.
implications: Memorize anything rote.
related works: Sketchy, art of memory, Lynne Kelly.
eval plan: 
  IV - Generated image vs human-made.
  DV - Quality / coherence of scene.
  Tasks - See method.
  Potential threats - Not coherent.
