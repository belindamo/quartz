actual time: 
problem: Generating effective spaced repetition cards manually from Obsidian notes or URL links is labor-intensive and requires skill.
bit: Currently, creating spaced repetition cards is a manual, effortful process.
flip: Automating the creation and organization of spaced repetition cards from existing information sources.
instantiate solution: Develop a tool to extract key information from Obsidian files and URLs, generate spaced repetition cards, and visualize their interconnections in a graph, introducing new cards over time.
method: Develop an Obsidian plugin integrated with a GPT assistant for conversational interaction and card generation, using local files for review sessions.
evaluation: I will evaluate the success based on the quality of the generated cards and whether the reduced friction encourages me to maintain this memorization habit.
implications: If successful, this method could be used during daily activities like walking, allowing for verbal interaction with spaced repetition cards, reducing screen time and enhancing learning efficiency.

eval plan: "  - IV: Generating spaced repetition cards in two steps: first, creating a concept graph, then generating cards from this graph.  - DV: Speed of learning and speed of curriculum creation.  - Task: Generating the concept graph and subsequent cards.  - Threats: Poor quality of generated content leading to confusion and extensive card revisions."
