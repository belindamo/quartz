problem: Difficulty in tracking multiple projects and associated research questions.
bit: Using Obsidian to write down and update project details, but facing challenges with retention and needing to reference the file for recall.
flip: Implementing spaced repetition to enable recall of projects and research questions without external references.
instantiate solution: Utilize Obsidian's spaced repetition plugin to create notecards for each project and research question.
method: Obsidian Spaced Repetition Plugin
evaluation: Success based on adherence to the spaced repetition routine and ability to recall all projects and questions satisfactorily without external aids.
implications: Successful application could extend to other learning areas, with a documented step-by-step method for integrating spaced repetition cards into Obsidian notes for consistent and effective use.

How do I memorize all my ongoing projects and keep them in my head?

Furthermore, can I remember an entire tree?

like...
shortcut my learning process...
the AI tutor can create spaced repetition cards for me based on a MOOC, book, or documentation site.

maybe this is third step after (1) creating my own knoweldge graph (2) [[2. What would a knowledge graph of science look like, generated recursively entirely by GPT-4?]] (modeled after that ) (3) this




this can be great! this can be useful to actually like learn stuff and keep it in my brain lol
