title: How effectively can natural language objectives be automatically compiled into structured model system evaluations?

problem: Current model evaluation requires manual setup and documentation of evaluation criteria

bit: Manual creation of evaluation frameworks, datasets, and metrics

flip: Automated compilation of natural language objectives into structured evaluation systems

instantiate solution: A system that takes natural language objectives and docker environment, and automatically generates:

- New evaluations
    
- Model system components
    
- System prompts
    
- One/Few shot Messages
    

- Evaluation tree: retrieved from set of existing evaluations
    

Cycle consistency, LLM-as-a-judge, LLM-as-adversary and other high-level multi-agent strategies are employed
