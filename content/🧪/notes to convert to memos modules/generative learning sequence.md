- Question - How do we increase speed to learn and long-term retention? 
- Context - [[Quantified learning]]
- Answer - See below
- Primarily for personal learning or novel discovery? - novel discovery
- What is the [[delta]]? - Time to learn, quality of learning

# Method

- Time: 1 month
- 2 phases
	- Learn a concept: cycle through the materials until learned, then activate review phase.
	- Review a concept: this is triggered upon completion of learn phase.

## 15 total tests: 
For each combination, make 50-100 flashcards. See [[Quantified learning]] for data structures.

**(3 Concept subjects x 2 Representation types x 2 Representation captureModalities) + (1 baseline experiment for each of the 3 Concept subjects) = 12 + 3 = 15 combinations** 

- Subject vs Subject vs Subject (Concept subject): (1) Language learning (src: anki decks), (2) natural language/trivia (src: wikipedia), (3) deep learning/math (src: textbook/blogs/code)
- Flashcard vs Memory palace (Representation type)
- Type conversation vs Verbal conversation (captureMethod is constant, captureModality is changed)
- 3 baseline experiments: 
	- Language learning: anki, vs my own system
	- Natural language/wiki trivia: make my own flashcards from scratch, vs generate/chat
	- Deep learning/math related: make my own flashcards from scratch, vs generate/chat
## Subjects & their sources

1. Language learning
	- B1 Spanish - online Anki flashcards
2. Natural language / trivia
	- Wikipedia articles about philosophy and religion.
3. Deep learning / math
	- Stanford's [CS 229 coursereader and problem sets](https://github.com/maxim5/cs229-2018-autumn/tree/main). Equations and bitesized problems to solve

# Metrics
The application will need to track:

| **Metric**                                         | **How to measure**                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time to learn a concept                            | Timer (ms) during learning phase                                     |
| Correlation between a concept and a representation | cosine similarity of embedding                                       |
| Average time to review a card                      | Timer (ms) during review phase                                       |
| Lifetime time to review a card                     | Timer (ms) during review phase                                       |
| How well I feel I know this topic                  | Synthetically generated test based on source material and flashcards |
|                                                    |                                                                      |

# Potential risks
- Comprehension of topic is based on synthetically generated test which may be biased towards the learning materials generated by the system. 
- Variation of source materials within a single subject
- Potential confirmation bias towards what I'd expect to be a more efficient system may lead
- Whether material that is being remembered is appropriately weighted for what the learner really would like to learn
- This is tested with *n* of 1. Maybe 2 or 3.

# Future experiments
- Different types of flashcards
- Different types of memory palaces
- Other formats
	- Vivid stories as a way to learn
	- Memorize examples of using a formula
- Prompt variability
- Feedback mechanisms
- Testing intervals
- More subjects

# Results
This will be filled in over time.
