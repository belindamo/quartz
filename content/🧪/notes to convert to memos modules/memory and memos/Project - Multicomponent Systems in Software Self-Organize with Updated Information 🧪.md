problem: Modern code generation tools falter when handling extensive contexts that necessitate the prioritization of myriad concepts, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficiencies in software development processes.
bit: Existing systems lack a sophisticated scaffolding framework capable of intelligently managing and prioritizing the complex interplay of various components within large contexts, resulting in a static integration of software components that demands manual oversight for updates and optimizations.
flip: The proposal introduces an innovative scaffolding framework designed to autonomously prioritize concepts within vast contexts, leveraging a modular composition of deterministic and probabilistic functions, along with model components. This framework aims to facilitate the dynamic reorganization and optimization of these components in response to evolving information, thereby enhancing the system's adaptability and efficiency.
instantiate solution: Development of a cutting-edge system architecture that empowers software components to automatically restructure and refine their operations based on incoming data. This architecture will incorporate modular elements, including deterministic functions, probabilistic functions, and various model components, which will interact through meticulously defined protocols to ensure seamless adaptation and self-organization in the face of new information.
method: The method involves the architectural design and implementation of a scaffolded, modular framework that encapsulates both deterministic and probabilistic functions, along with critical model components. These modules will be designed to interact via a set of predefined protocols, allowing for the prioritization of concepts within intricate contexts, specifically tailored for advanced code generation tasks.
evaluation: Test the framework's capability to manage and prioritize context in scenarios with hypothetically infinite amounts of information and code generation needs. Using personal data management as a specific example, the evaluation will focus on the system's hierarchical structuring ability to handle multiple levels of complexity and infinite context layers. The goal is to demonstrate the framework's scalability and adaptability in modularizing systems for enhanced efficiency and dynamic reorganization.
implications: |-
  This could hold a hypothetically infinite amounts of context is necessary here to mention, and infinite amounts of code. If you think about a hierarchical system with infinite amounts of levels, that's what we're trying to achieve here by modularizing this system.

  This groundbreaking approach has the potential to significantly alter the landscape of software system design, ushering in a new era of adaptive, efficient, and self-organizing software architectures. By addressing the critical challenge of managing and prioritizing complex information in extensive contexts, the proposed framework promises to enhance the capabilities and productivity of software development processes substantially.
related works: The literature review will encompass an analysis of seminal works such as the "Peano Axioms", "Dreamcoder", "AutoML", "MoE", "soft max" papers, alongside an examination of related products like GitHub Copilot and Lean4. These resources will provide valuable insights into the realms of modular software architecture, adaptive systems, and sophisticated code generation techniques, setting a robust foundation for the proposed framework.
eval plan: "  - DV: The primary metric for evaluation will be the system's proficiency in dynamically adapting to new information streams and generating functional, effective software solutions.  - IV: The evaluation will scrutinize the system's modularity, focusing on the diversity, complexity, and interoperability of the included modules.  - Task: The core task will involve the generation and integration of the scaffolding framework and its constituent modules, ensuring cohesive and efficient operation.  - Threats: Potential scalability challenges associated with managing an expanding array of modules, and the risk of inadequacies in the protocols governing module interactions, which could compromise system functionality and efficiency."
