problem: The reliance on cloud-based models for AI interactions poses privacy and data security risks due to potential changes in privacy policies by model or cloud providers.
bit: Current AI implementations, including ChatGPT, typically operate by communicating with cloud-based servers, leading to potential privacy and data security vulnerabilities.
flip: Transitioning ChatGPT to a local-only operation model, ensuring all interactions and data remain on the user's device without external server communication.
instantiate solution: Develop a version of ChatGPT that can be easily deployed and run locally on personal devices, maintaining full functionality without the need for external server access.
method: Develop a mobile-first application where all user data is stored locally by default, with clear, user-controlled options to selectively sync or store data in the cloud. This approach empowers users to manage their data privacy and security actively.
evaluation: 
  - Performance Speed: Match or exceed the cloud-based counterpart's speed.
  - Ease of Data Control: Straightforward management of data sources and model preferences.
  - Convenience and Data Persistence: Solutions for data backup and recovery to prevent loss upon app deletion.
implications: 
  - Paradigm Shift: Demonstrates a move away from big data models, emphasizing user privacy.
  - Consumer Empowerment: Provides a tool that prioritizes user control over personal data.
related works: 
  - Signal: End-to-end encrypted messaging platform prioritizing user privacy.
  - Telegram: Offers end-to-end encryption, highlighting user control.
  - WhatsApp (pre-Facebook): Known for encryption, emphasizing privacy despite cloud server use.
eval plan: 
  - IV: Local storage implementation.
  - DV: User-perceived safety and actual data security.
  - Task: Develop a mobile interface with local caching.
  - Threats: Local storage limitations or mobile platform constraints.
