 1. Convert every part of math into a computation using LLMs
2. Test each part with many test cases, so that it gets to 100% for all test cases.
3. Run a prompt to find contradictions or novel solutions


# Approach 1 - Increased complexity
We can find contradictions or advancements, that were previously (1) too computationally complex for humans to follow with conscious thought and (2) requires pattern recognition roughly equivalent to that of a human.

In math, there are statements that are provable but that require too many logical steps and/or too much memory for our human brains to process. 

# Field 1: Math
This can be accomplished in math. 

We can start with a series of axioms in math, perhaps imported from the Principia Mathematica.
