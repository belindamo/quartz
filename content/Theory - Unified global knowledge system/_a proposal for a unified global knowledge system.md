There is a limitation as well. The brain contains a finite amount of storage, short of brain computer interfaces. What if what we learn clutters the brain?
We’re not built for 100% retention. That’s why we must have it be small enough for that case. It must also be revisitable in a way to make the most of pattern recognition capabilities that humans have, as well as recallable out of order (probably, spatially)
“A human master in a particular field has mastered about 100,000 chunks of knowledge” // 39, how to create a mind

# What is the importance of a unified global knowledge system?
1. Humans have limited storage and memory
2. Collaboration between human-human, human-machine, machine-machine

(this could be taken into...)
We spend our entire days learning material in childhood and for some of us, adulthood too. In the U.S., we learn from age 7 to 18 from 8 am to 2 pm in school. After going home, there is a few hours of homework. So much of our childhood is spent learning. With knowledge work coming to prominence, a good portion of adulthood is also spent learning. 

Why is it, then, that we struggle to retain the information that we spend so much time learning? 

The core American education system for high schoolers is determined by state government organizations. For example, California's Department of Education hosts the [California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE)](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/sp/). Americans or Canadians who want to show proficiency of high school education without completing high school may also take the [General Education Development (GED)](https://ged.com/) test.

The advanced American education system for high schoolers is determined by two primary organizations: the [College Board for Advanced Placement courses (APs) and the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT)](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/course-index-page), the [International Baccalaureate for IB programming](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/).

In college and beyond, . . . to continue here

Khan has tests up to college level https://www.khanacademy.org/

Retention here is defined as recall with near 100% accuracy. 
The answer is not that we should not learn, but rather than we should learn better incorporating the history of learning techniques that have been used globally. 
This is the first reason. We spend so much time learning, and it is a shame if we cannot recall it with near 100% accuracy. This information is meant to prepare us for a rich, informed life. 

A rebuttal - one may say, is all that information in childhood and adulthood actually useful for me? 
To that point, I would say yes.
There are some pieces that are practically useful such as arithmetic. You practically cannot survive in the modern world if you do not know arithmetic for adult tasks like buying groceries, paying bills, and more. 
There are other pieces that are less obviously useful, like art history. However, who is to say that will not be useful at a later point in life, say if you are making a career change? In addition, there is a joy for knowledge and learning itself that I believe is virtuous to cultivate in the self and sets you up as a rounded, informed individual.

Retention accuracy for natural language is also a major difference between human and machines. Alignment between human and machine is also essential. 
This system ensures a structured way for computer systems to query human knowledge with 100% certainty that every piece of knowledge is vetted. 
This solves the issue of AI models spitting lies, at least for this important knowledge.
A second reason.

Lastly, unification between human and human. Coming from different global backgrounds make it difficult to communicate. Today, numbers are the most common language. 
We must align ourselves in our incentives, through this base. 
We will thus be able to have logical conversations with people on a defined basis of communication. 
A third reason.

In order for recall to be achieved with this level of accuracy requires two things:
1. Spaced repetition to beat the learning curve
2. Memory artifacts that are sticky.

# What is new about this structure
This is merely a continuation of what humans have been doing in knowledge. We seek for this to be an additional continuation of learning that:
1. Improves distribution of unified system
2. Improves life-long retention
3. Accounts for the advent of computers for group organization
We are merely synthesizing what many others before us have discovered. 

From a data structure standpoint, this structure is a deterministic finite automata with version control, optimized for widespread use.  

# What has been done

To look forward, first we must look back.
There are multiple threads throughout the history of human education that we can follow.
We can split up education into memory and comprehension. Memory can be further split into: learning, retention, and recall. Comprehension refers to the contents of which we are learning. 

Memory artifacts and palaces - they've been used for ages.

### The value of Principia Mathematica conceptually applied across fields
The Principia Mathematica by Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell was an attempt to show that Math could be represented via hierarchical axioms in a complete and consistent system. 

While Gödel proved that math is not a complete system, at least under the PM, the statements that he referred to were all self-referential. We additionally look at later theorems that show incompleteness such as the [Paris-Harrington Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%E2%80%93Harrington_theorem) which also shows self-referencing. Thus, if we approach 

### Memory techniques 
There have been many [[memory]] techniques.

These can be traced back to the *ad horenium* in Classical times. Most recently, Lynne Kelly is an anthropologist who has been gathering techniques used by civilizations for thousands of years.

The advantages of such techniques is that they significantly increase retention of large amounts of knowledge that intuitively do not stick. There are modern-day memory champions who can memorize an ordered deck of cards in under 20 seconds. Medical students have been using memory palaces quite successfully, even using the same one like [sketch medical](https://blog.sketchy.com/mcat/how-to-remember-tough-mcat-topics).

At the end of the day, the reason why memory palaces are effective is because humans did not evolve to remember many abstract symbols such as words and numbers, so much as it evolved to remember data in visual, audio, tactile, taste, and smell formats. Thus, to 

Many of these techniques can be translated to modern day computer data structures.

These techniques include:
- Using tactile artifacts

### Computational data structures
- table 
- Decision tree 
- Linked list 

And roughly, you can display them as so

- Roll objects - to remember decision tree


### Current standards for educational achievement 
It’s essential that we build on top of what has already been said. 

# Schema for the unified knowledge base

The qualifications include the following:
- Version history
- Base that is annotatable
	- Base is the same for all
	- Annotations by individuals tie it to their context & helps with retention
- Multi-modal, with text version as most condensed source of truth
	- Multi-modality aids in retention and group distribution
	- Modalities in: medium, natural language
	- Modalities can be displayed simultaneously in a harmonious way
	- Knowledge is brought to the physical world with all 5 senses
- Uses memory techniques for retention
	- This may include: memory journeys, artifacts, etc. (inspired by [Memory Craft](https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Craft-Improve-Powerful-Methods/dp/1643133241))
	- Retention plan follows the forgetting curve
- Knowledge is prioritized based on (1) observable truth, (2) credibility, and (3) useful outcomes to come from retrieving this knowledge
	- Thus, it is grounded in science
	- It prioritizes facts from credible sources that have held true over time
	- this may prioritize democratic debate by (1) elected elders, (2) the public
- The most credible sources are those that are observable, such as what is found through science
- Human, computer and language model-referencable
	- Proposal may include [[a proposal for a standard format for personalized information||a standard format for personalized information]]
	- Small enough to be human-memorizable
- Structure is recursively decomposable
	- Super-classes and sub-classes for a given base follow the same format
	- Structure can be pulled from a series of embeddings
- Evergreen format?

The artifacts are as follows
- Memory palace 
- Computer program that can generate a memory palace given a graph of data

Levels to learning
These levels are recursively decomposable. That means that a higher level of understanding means that the levels go deeper, rather than higher.

### Structure in practice - scientific knowledge base
This is an example that pulls from scientific knowledge. The reason we've started here is because it is more structured and verifiable as true.

### Applying this structure to other domains
The good thing about this type of structure is that it can be applied to other domains besides the scientific one. It can

To explore: Adding certainty levels 

Pitfalls: we must consider closely the limitations of such a system as well. 

### Conclusion
For the sake of improved human retention, human communication, and human-machine communication, this unified system is essential. 

### Afterword
#### Personal motivations
My motivation here is simple. Mainly, I want to consolidate my learnings from my past 25 years on this earth, and distill it into a referenceable knowledge base. Mainly, I want to have a knowledge base that is grounded in physically observable truth
This is a unified knowledge base + decision making system that (1) can be retained in and retrieved from human memory with 100% accuracy and (2) is computer interaction friendly

##### Introduction
We are at the point now where the tool has near become the master.
These stories have existed throughout history. There are the ones like Haephastus that forged their own kind. Frankenstein is a more recent one, from the 1800s. And there are stories as well of Gods that
This brings to question, is there truly a difference between the physical-only and those who have a spiritual side? In the 1800s there were those who stated some part of the brain must be spiritually based. 
To me, scientific knowledge is merely a natural evolution of the spiritual. Change is continuous, not discrete, though we try to add milestones and computation is discrete so we often forget this fact. 
If you believe that consciousness is an emergent property, then you must accept that we are merely physical creatures. Thus, we must take science as the newest. It is the new “religion”, in the sense that we are.
To be explicit, this is *not* a religion. 
If you are not interested in science, this may not be for you. But I’d still recommend reading the “why science?” section
From Aristotle, Galileo, Bacon, Newton, Russell, Godel, Turing who were able to achieve non-obvious breakthroughs in our understanding of the physical world, we’ve moved from rhetoric, science, physics, math system, mathematical limits, computability
This book does not focus on the actual base, but rather describes the need for a base like this and what the criteria must be to create. Still, at the end is what I would say is a proposed beginning to the base.
Where EA gets it wrong: empathy & legibility
My background is that I studied Symbolic Systems
