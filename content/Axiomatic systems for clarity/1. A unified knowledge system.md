# I. Theory

## 1. The structure of a unified global knowledge system
The schema of a unified knowledge system

- Some properties of the knowledge system are:
	- It is a formal system
	- Theoretically infinite levels
- Differing levels of certainty in differing fields
	- List the fields
- Mathematically speaking how is this modeled? 
	- (Important to spend time thinking on this...) Can we have a formal system that encodes uncertainty but is still formal? I think, yes....by adding one layer of abstraction
	- What is a formal system and what is not?
	- Theoretically, this can have infinite levels 
	- Localization is necessary 
	- Levels are determined where properties ("meta") of a concept no longer apply

This is related to ![[Proposal for Explainable Data Structures and Protocols for Human and Machine Long-Term Memory#Design considerations]]
![[a proposal for a unified global knowledge system#Schema for the unified knowledge base]]
## 2. Collaborating via a formal system

- This is theory corollary to II.4 decision making
- What happens after a decision is made, to maintain?
	- Does the concept of equilibrium apply?
- Inspiration is taken from: Git version control, benchmarking
- Would this collaboration method be able to substitute communication for consensus via words and body language?
- Could we achieve inference alignment across all levels? 
	- true/false system
	- probabilistically
	- language model reasons
	- language model intuition
	- human reason
	- human intuition

## 3. Strange loops and other limitations of a formal system
- Strange loop
	- may involve reference and paradox

## 4. Augmenting memory of entities using different locales
- Entities: any part of the world that is capable of learning, retrieving, and retaining information in the formal system
- Different sets of entities will have different locales and levels that they look at
- Explain how information may be learned, retrieved, and retained from this formal system
- Isomorphisms of biological human memory techniques to those of other entities
	- Hopefully, one day we may reduce lossiness of isomorphisms to the point of near elimination
- Retrieval may be done via accessing through the body's senses. 
	- The most visceral experiences of retrieval will be difficult to communicate via text

# II. Applied
For each,
1. Dataset & Structure
	1. Where does the dataset come from?
2. Why is this system significant? For who, what, when, where and why
3. 100 examples each of learning, retention, and retrieval

## 1. A reductive map of human knowledge
- [[A reductive map of human knowledge.canvas|_A reductive map of human knowledge]]
- [[Science graph.canvas|science graph]]
## 2. A formal system for attaining excellence in a given locale

## 3. A formal system for long-term retention of personal knowledge

## 4. A formal system for personal decision making

## 5. A formal system for this book

### A formal system for novel research discoveries

### Other examples

- Legal system
- Israel and Hamas War 2023

# III. Ethical Assumptions

## 0. No intentional killing of any beings may be encoded in formal system.

## 1. No intentional physiological harm of any beings may be encoded in formal system.
- This means physical and mental harm.
- Define harm?
## 1. A being on the same level is equal.
- This applies to nonhuman beings too
- Their experiences and opinions are treated equally

## 2. It's axioms all the way down.
- Given infinite axioms and infinite levels, there are infinite ways of rearranging them. ,
- The system is based on empirical data, truthfully reported, first and foremost
	- Just because a set is infinite does not mean it does not exclude
- Consensus is secondary, to resolve uncertainty points

## 3. Maximum transparency is the path to peace.
- Necessary for collaboration

## 4. Use appropriate metrics with appropriate levels of quantitative and qualitative metrics, weighting conclusions based on uncertainty.

## 5. Differing locales and levels may inherently contradict.
- In this case, larger locale overrule smaller locale. This does not mean the person overseeing the larger lcoale is superior, but rather their locale takes precedent

## 6. No intentional killing of any beings may be encoded in formal system.

## 7. No axiom is absolute.

#### Personal motivations
My motivation here is simple. Mainly, I want to consolidate my learnings from my past 25 years on this earth, and distill it into a referenceable knowledge base. Mainly, I want to have a knowledge base that is grounded in physically observable truth
This is a unified knowledge base + decision making system that (1) can be retained in and retrieved from human memory with 100% accuracy and (2) is computer interaction friendly



## Scratch

### Introduction
We are at the point now where the tool has near become the master.
These stories have existed throughout history. There are the ones like Haephastus that forged their own kind. Frankenstein is a more recent one, from the 1800s. And there are stories as well of Gods that
This brings to question, is there truly a difference between the physical-only and those who have a spiritual side? In the 1800s there were those who stated some part of the brain must be spiritually based. 
To me, scientific knowledge is merely a natural evolution of the spiritual. Change is continuous, not discrete, though we try to add milestones for explainability and computation is discrete so we often forget this fact. 
If you believe that consciousness is an emergent property, then you must accept that we are merely physical creatures. Thus, we must take science as the newest. It is the new “religion”, in the sense that we are.
To be explicit, this is *not* a religion. 
If you are not interested in science, this may not be for you. But I’d still recommend reading the “why science?” section
From Aristotle, Galileo, Bacon, Newton, Russell, Godel, Turing who were able to achieve non-obvious breakthroughs in our understanding of the physical world, we’ve moved from rhetoric, science, physics, math system, mathematical limits, computability
This book does not focus on the actual base, but rather describes the need for a base like this and what the criteria must be to create. Still, at the end is what I would say is a proposed beginning to the base.
Where EA gets it wrong: empathy (metta and other physical states) & legibility
