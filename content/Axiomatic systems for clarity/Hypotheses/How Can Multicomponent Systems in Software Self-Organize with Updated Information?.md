## Summary:

It seems that the next step in software is the ability for systems to adapt and reorganize themselves in response to new information. This proposal delves into a scaffolding framework that enables software components to self-organize and optimize their operations autonomously. The proposed system is a radical departure from traditional static software integration, offering a dynamic solution that manages the complex interplay of various components within long, and theoretically infinite, contexts.

Existing tools have an inability to efficiently handle long context windows which often lose ability to prioritize many concepts. This inefficiency leads to a bottleneck in AI-powered development processes. We hope this framework that modularizes deterministic and probabilistic / statistical (this includes LLMs) functions will enable any system to update towards an objective in real-time.

If this works, this system will be able to hold **theoretically infinite amounts of context**, which means generating theoretically infinite amounts of useful code. This is a modular, hierarchical system that could have theoretically infinite levels.

## Related Works:

The literature review will include papers such as the Dreamcoder, Peano Axioms, and MoE papers as well as an examination of products like GitHub Copilot and Lean4. These works will provide a solid foundation and context for the proposed framework, offering insights into modular architecture, adaptive systems, and advanced code generation techniques.

## Plan:

The core of this project involves architecting a modular framework that houses:
- deterministic functions
- probabilistic functions
- Large Language Models
- components of Large Language Models
- Smaller models
- components of smaller models

These elements are designed to interact through well-defined protocols, enabling the system to dynamically prioritize and manage complex contexts. The approach is particularly tailored for advanced code generation tasks, where the capacity to handle intricate, evolving information is crucial.

### Methodology:

- **Architectural Design**: Crafting a scaffolded, modular framework to encapsulate critical functions and components.
- **Module Interaction**: Establishing protocols for the interaction between modules, ensuring seamless operation and adaptability.
- **Context Management**: Implementing mechanisms for the prioritization of concepts within extensive contexts, enabling efficient information handling.

## Evaluation:

The framework's success will be measured against its ability to manage and prioritize complex information within infinite contexts, especially in the realm of personal data management. The evaluation will focus on scalability, adaptability, and performance, using a detailed use case to assess the system's capability in real-world scenarios.

### Evaluation Plan:

- **Independent Variable (IV)**: Modularity of the system, assessed through the diversity, complexity, and interoperability of modules.
- **Dependent Variable (DV)**: System's adaptability to new information and its effectiveness in generating viable software solutions.
- **Task**: Integration of the scaffolding framework and its components to ensure cohesive operation.
- **Threats**: Challenges in scalability and potential inadequacies in module interaction protocols that could impact system efficiency.

## Implications:

Test the framework's capability to manage and prioritize context in scenarios with hypothetically infinite amounts of information and code generation needs. Using personal data management as a specific example, the evaluation will focus on the system's hierarchical structuring ability to handle multiple levels of complexity and infinite context layers. The goal is to demonstrate the framework's scalability and adaptability in modularizing systems for enhanced efficiency and dynamic reorganization.
