## Motivations

I’d like to have a referenceable knowledge base that is grounded in physically observable truth, computer and human-legible, and useful. 

I studied an interdisciplinary major called Symbolic Systems on computer science, psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, and then started a [seed startup on language translation](http://vivatranslate.com). This has made me think a lot about overlaps in knowledge frameworks and cross-contextual communication. 

I’m in between startups at the moment and would like to consolidate my learnings from my past 25 years alive, distilling it into a referenceable knowledge base. 

## Project + Scope

The project has two parts:

1. A proposal for a globally unified knowledge base that can be retained in and retrieved from both computer and human memory with 100% accuracy.
2. Build an actual knowledge base based on what I’ve learned so far in my life. This will likely exist in (1) text and (2) brain memory palace formats. 

Tentatively, here are the rules that I see this knowledge base to follow:

- Version history
- Base that is annotatable
- Base is the same for all
- Annotations by individuals tie it to their context & helps with retention
- Multi-modal, with text version as most condensed source of truth
- Multi-modality aids in retention and group distribution
- Uses memory techniques for retention
	- This may include: memory journeys, artifacts, etc. (inspired by [Memory Craft](https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Craft-Improve-Powerful-Methods/dp/1643133241))
- Knowledge is prioritized based on (1) observable truth, (2) credibility, and (3) useful outcomes to come from retrieving this knowledge
	- Thus, it is grounded in science
- It prioritizes facts from credible sources that have held true over time
- Human, computer and language model-referencable
- Proposal may include a standard format for personalized information 
- Small enough to be human-memorizable
- Structure is recursively decomposable
- Super-classes and sub-classes for a given base follow the same format
- Structure can be pulled from a series of embeddings

It is likely that this project will influence my next startup plans, which is around building agentic systems for day-to-day tasks. The plan, at the very least, is that this project will live on in my head as a knowledge base that I will reference throughout the day and will keep up to date + fresh using spaced repetition.
