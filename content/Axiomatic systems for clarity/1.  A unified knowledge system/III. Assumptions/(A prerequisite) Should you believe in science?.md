Before engaging in this knowledge base, one must first question whether science is the right approach. 

The entire premise of such a knowledge base as the source of truth is irrelevant if you do not perceive that observations made by our 5 senses and tools that extend our 5 senses, to be the biggest source of truth. 

I think that's quite alright. It is impossible to fully decouple our perceptions of the world with our values.

Though, given that we have been able to make many advancements in **predicting the future** with science as the primary framework, I think it may be erroneous to pursue another framework to thinking about life. 

I do believe somewhere in the future, if we survive as humans, there will be some framework distinctly different from our current conception of science, that is even more accurate in predicting the future. It may even be at that point, humans have access to more computation directly in our brains, and then the framework that we conceive of then is better but today is not currently possible.



(when science is not a helpful framework)
Another thing - science itself does not inform the moral items of *why* we should do certain things. 
I have my personal opinions of this. Philosophically, I really do not see a true distinction between our selves, other selves, and our environments. To harm our environment is to harm the self, on a long time scale, because the self eventually returns to the environment. *Time scale* is really the key here (see [[power - the ocean and beach, waves]]). 
I think it would benefit us to come to consensus of our collective moral compass for taking certain actions and align on that, even if taking actions in accordance to this moral compass may harm the self. 
One suggestion that I think almost everyone would agree with is, "It is wrong to kill other people" (Torah, Bible, Quran, other religious texts, legal systems, etc.). But what if they provoke us first? Then, we may update this as, "It is wrong to kill other people who did not intend to kill us". Then, assuming harm is on a spectrum, we may reduce this further to a more unit basis: "It is wrong to harm in the same level, other people who did not intend to harm us." The truly compassionate may reduce this and accelerate our path to collective peace as "It is wrong to harm other people who did not intend to harm us." 
The most extreme of this, considering a lack of distinction between the self and the environment, is "It is wrong to harm the self, other selves, and our environments  who did not intend to harm us."

Let's consider what "harm" really means. And to what extent. 

### Why science tho?
- When is science a helpful framework
- When is science not a helpful framework

## Misc.
- can have more layers of abstraction to make a tall building
- building blocks are sound with mathematically based thing.
- error rates compound with low quality studies
- psych - itâ€™s new things proposed bc building blocks are not sound
