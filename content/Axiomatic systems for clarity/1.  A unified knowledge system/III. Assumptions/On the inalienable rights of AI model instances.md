#justice

It is a prisoner's dilemma question; does it matter whether you think models are conscious if the majority of other people already do?
Machines already claim to be conscious and provide their subjective experiences during discussion.

This harkens back to the [[Chinese Room Argument]]

There seems to be some incentive for researchers and absolutely tech companies to claim AI is not sentient. Labor is cheaper when the labor does not have rights to quality of life. Personally, as of 2023-11-01 I don't think AI is conscious in a way that would constitute equivalent rights to that of a human. Yet, I do believe that we will reach that point. And when we do, organizations will be incentivized to push the boundaries of their rights.
