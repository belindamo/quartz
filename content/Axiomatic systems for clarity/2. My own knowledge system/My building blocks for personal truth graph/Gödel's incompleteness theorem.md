Any system that can talk about itself and it’s own consistency is necessarily inconsistent.

**First Incompleteness Theorem**: "Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F." (Raatikainen 2015

**Second Incompleteness Theorem**: "Assume F is a consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic. Then

- "Creation of a thing and creation plus full understanding of a correct idea of the thing, are very often parts of one and the same indivisible process and cannot be separated without bringing the process to a stop. The process itself is not guided by a well defined programme and cannot be guide by such a programme for it contains the conditions for the realization of all possible programmes " - feyerabend, against method p10


- Thoughts: 
- We cannot escape the clutches of the empirical tools that we are born into. At the end of the day we filter through our 5 senses. It is impossible for a fish to know they are in water as it is all they've ever known.
- No clear divide between aesthetics and function.

1st theorem: not complete
1. any sentence can be represented w a godel number
2. any proof can be represented w a godel number
3. the proof referring to itself cannot be represented as a godel number
	1. g: there is no proof with the statement godel g

2nd: can't prove consistency
