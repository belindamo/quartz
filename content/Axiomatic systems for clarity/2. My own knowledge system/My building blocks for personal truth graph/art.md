**Creation** is a process where a being receives input, applies their filter, and uses material to create output. Most of the time it refers to human creation. 

There are lots of cases of this:
- Coding a note-taking app
- Blacksmithing a sword
- Giving a speech

**Art** is a creation that resonates with at least one node, which is the self. This creation may be placed in any number of categories, including aesthetic, scientific, or conceptual. 

Art that can be used to create more art is a [[tool]].

Art that resonates with beings outside of the creator is [[design]]. Design that is distributed to those beings is a [[product]].
