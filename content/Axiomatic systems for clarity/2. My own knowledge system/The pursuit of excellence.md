The pursuit of excellence is a fickle thing.

I don't think it should be so painful that a person feels as if they want to die. 

I don't know why it makes me feel like I want to die.

Yet we see in high pressure high schools and colleges, a higher rate of suicides. 

"no pain no gain"

I think I've felt it since I was a kid.

It started in gymnastics.
I saw Tessa who ran away before the olympics, from her mom and her coaches. I remember someone whispered to me that she ran away with her boyfriend to Nevada.

It seemed to continue from there.
