First, what are my personal motivations for proposing this system? This will inevitably affect the tone and focus of subsequent statements. 

My primary goal is to synthesize the knowledge I've accumulated over the past 25 years into a reliable and reference-able knowledge base, one that is firmly rooted in observable physical truths.

I aim to develop a comprehensive knowledge and decision-making system that can be near-perfectly stored in and accessed from human memory, while also being compatible with computer interfaces.
