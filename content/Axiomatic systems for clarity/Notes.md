The human body gathers rich sensory data through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, organs, and more. This data is then compressed into our body's memory and retrieved when relevant. We convert some of this sensory data predominantly into explainable symbols, while other data remains primarily stored in a sensory format. Some sensory data is lost, becoming irretrievable.

The schema of a unified knowledge system

- Some properties of the knowledge system are:
	- It is a formal system
	- Theoretically infinite levels
- Differing levels of certainty in differing fields
	- List the fields
- Referencing to different levels of abstraction
- Mathematically speaking how is this modeled? 
	- (Important to spend time thinking on this...) Can we have a formal system that encodes uncertainty but is still formal? I think, yes....by adding one layer of abstraction
	- What is a formal system and what is not?
	- Theoretically, this can have infinite levels 
	- Localization is necessary 
	- Levels are determined where properties ("meta") of a concept no longer apply

## Scratch

### Introduction
We are at the point now where the tool has near become the master.
These stories have existed throughout history. There are the ones like Haephastus that forged their own kind. Frankenstein is a more recent one, from the 1800s. And there are stories as well of Gods that
This brings to question, is there truly a difference between the physical-only and those who have a spiritual side? In the 1800s there were those who stated some part of the brain must be spiritually based. 
To me, scientific knowledge is merely a natural evolution of the spiritual. Change is continuous, not discrete, though we try to add milestones for explainability and computation is discrete so we often forget this fact. 
If you believe that consciousness is an emergent property, then you must accept that we are merely physical creatures. Thus, we must take science as the newest. It is the new “religion”, in the sense that we are.
To be explicit, this is *not* a religion. 
If you are not interested in science, this may not be for you. But I’d still recommend reading the “why science?” section
From Aristotle, Galileo, Bacon, Newton, Russell, Godel, Turing who were able to achieve non-obvious breakthroughs in our understanding of the physical world, we’ve moved from rhetoric, science, physics, math system, mathematical limits, computability
This book does not focus on the actual base, but rather describes the need for a base like this and what the criteria must be to create. Still, at the end is what I would say is a proposed beginning to the base.
Where EA gets it wrong: empathy (metta and other physical states) & legibility

Past influences on memory
- Maybe a way to find rigorous research is by looking at what the most esteemed professors are studying, e.g. [Harvard Learning and Memory](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/research-themes/learning-and-memory) department professors
