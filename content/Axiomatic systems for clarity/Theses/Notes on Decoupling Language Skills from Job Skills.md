# Misc. Notes

Viva‚Äôs specific focus in the coming year is addressing 95% of the daily translation pain points that occur in a day in the life of a Spanish-speaking developer working on an English-speaking team.

## intro‚Ä¶

Viva provides a translation ecosystem that encompasses all day-to-day pain points around collaborating with someone who speaks a different language. The ecosystem will include bidirectional text communication, document translation, webpage translation, video translation, and ultimately in-person translation. Translations are domain-specific and context-aware, so they are more accurate than general-use tools. The first application of Viva‚Äôs ecosystem is to enable remote work across borders between English and Spanish. From there, Viva expands to additional use cases in personal, professional, and in-person realms.¬†

  

## Viva: A language tool to fast-track to the next decade of communication barrier removal

Viva provides a translation ecosystem across bi-directional communication, long-form documents, and real-time speech. This smoothens communication for any professional conversations across linguistic and cultural literacy.¬†

### 1. Accuracy: Rich, context-aware translations

Viva‚Äôs post-processing of messages and automated suggestions encourage trust. As we build out our own models, they can be used across many partners in our ecosystem.¬†

  

The areas of research for machine translation today, relevant to Viva, include quality estimation, domain-specific translation modeling, and domain ontologies. Most quality metrics today are done on lower performing languages, with the assumption that a high-resource pairing like Eng-Span is ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Yet, there are still a lot of context-aware changes such as handling pronouns, formality, gendered words, and tone.¬†

  

We can incorporate other NLP uses into machine translation workflow for consumers via large language models, fine-tuned for pre and post-processing.

### 2. Design: Live multi-modal translation

Speech translation currently lacks a smooth UI, has relatively high latency of translation, and has unreliable accuracy.

  

Viva improves the experience of live subtitled conversations to be usable. The rule of thumb here is that we could have a full 30 minute meeting and be comfortable communicating across languages - as easy as watching Netflix in another language with subtitles.¬†

  

There are two potential approaches to speech translation. One is through a speech-to-speech model. Another is through a combination of speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and translation models.¬†

### 3. Integrations: Anywhere all at once

By rapidly integrating with any workplace productivity software, Viva is much more convenient. The intention is that we will be integrated with the majority of mediums and software out there - mobile, desktop, web.¬†

  

Viva will do it faster, with more breadth, and more maintainability than any other translation product out there.

  
  

### English will not stay the sole dominant language of the professional working world.

  

In fact, English has been the second most-common native tongue in the world since 1995, trailing only Chinese. By 2050, Chinese will continue its predominance, with Hindi and Arabic climbing past English, and Spanish nearly equal to it.

  

Language barriers are a huge and oftentimes invisible barrier that causes talent loss. Viva allows people to exercise their highly-in-demand skills by breaking down language barriers using NLP.¬†

  
  

## History of Machine Translation and Remote Work

  

We are closer than ever. Since then, people have attempted statistical machine translation modeling. Systran was a major player coming out of France in the 1980s.¬†


As Google rose to prominence in the 2000s, they also created Google Translate (GT). GT was meant less to be an independently monetized model but rather to support the global user of Google Search and other products, thereby collecting more ad revenue and data. GT started with statistical MT but as other Google teams, other tech companies, and universities started using neural networks GT made the switch to neural machine translation, thereby increasing accuracy.¬†

Natural Language Processing

On a granular level, Viva contributes to the advancement of language translation.¬†

On a broader scale, Viva‚Äôs platform is a building block for a fundamental socioeconomic shift in global supply and demand - whether that is for hiring employees, finding the right job, buying products, collaborating in academia, making friends, or other daily activities. These interactions will happen across languages, and ultimately across all contexts, effortlessly.

foundation models

‚ÄúTransfer learning is what makes foundation models possible, but scale is what makes them powerful. Scale required three ingredients: (i) improvements in computer hardware ‚Äî e.g., GPU throughput and memory have increased 10√ó over the last four years (¬ß4.5: systems); (ii) the development of the Transformer model architecture [Vaswani et al. 2017] that leverages the parallelism of the hardware to train much more expressive models than before (¬ß4.1: modeling); and (iii) the availability of much more training data.‚Äù

- Spoken language translation is not good enough
    
- Written language translation is - ok - but not enough to give complete security that it translates accurately. It‚Äôs conversational level, not native fluency level.

### Different kind of workplace communications

There are different kinds of communications.¬†

  

hierarchical versus collaborative are two ends of the extreme.¬†

They are correlated as well to contract vs. full-time type of relationship.

In the short term, we restrict to more contractual relationship. We expand to a fuller relationship long-term

Interesting article about talent distribution [Harvard, Stanford, and MIT Researchers Study 1 Million Inventors To Find Secret To Success, And It's Not Talent | Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/a-study-of-one-million-inventors-identified-key-to-success-its-not-talent.html#:~:text=There's%20a%20popular%20quote%20attributed,%22available%22%20to%20all%20people)

Consider that today there are approximately 250 million knowledge workers globally. That's less than 10% of the world's three billion total workers. Yet, that 10% results in an inordinate percentage of the overall global economy, by some estimates contributing more than 50% to global GDP. Based on that we could easily double the growth rate of global economic output by increasing the number of knowledge workers by just single digit percentages. .

  

We want to unlock access to millions of jobs that weren‚Äôt previously accessible to non-fluent English speakers. Viva will increase language access for non-fluent English speakers and improve their livelihood by connecting them with career opportunities in the English-speaking parts of the world.

  

We enable a remote workforce that operates effortlessly regardless of language. We unlock the rest of the 80% of the world who doesn‚Äôt speak English.¬†

  

Our product and services help non-English speaking professionals find, secure, and work effectively on remote jobs - starting with the 160 million Spanish-speaking professionals across Latin America.

We provide an automatic translation platform focused on Spanish-English translations designed for specific industry domains and contexts.

Viva aims to bridge the gap between language and job access, and help businesses unlock the high-quality talent in non-fluent English-speaking communities.

We provide access to supply of employers/jobs who are willing to hire non-English speaking tech workers. Viva enables non-English speaking tech workers to gain employment on English speaking teams using our own community group.¬†

  
  

Hmm

- Language is already an imperfect way of conveying information. (Cross-language and culture makes it even harder.)
    

- energy gifts
    

- It‚Äôs very difficult to learn English as an adult so we make it easy to communicate even without learning the other language (though we may help in doing so)
    

  
  

And we probably don‚Äôt want that anyways. It is not necessary to speak one language anyways to collaborate, if the right tools are in place.¬†

  
  

‚ÄúThe ability to speak English became a portal to a universe of possibilities ‚Äì to new countries, jobs, ideas, and the Internet. Learning a new language allowed them to access a global information economy that wasn‚Äôt limited by their location.‚Äù
