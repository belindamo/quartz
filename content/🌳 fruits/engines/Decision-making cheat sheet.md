	2. ^in order to build, *iterate*, a robust engine, it is necessary to have this. 

Non-urgent steps
- [ ] Each algorithm cites principles
- [ ] ssm, drilldown, and 5 step stored in brain to retrieve throughout day. If I expect to revisit these 3-5x a day. It is worth storing with loci. This is part of building a machine
- [ ] Have algorithms be coded into a program
- [ ] Have [[Decision-making cheat sheet#Engines|engines]] be coded from algorithms

# Criteria for what I want to work on
1. People
2. Likelihood of a masterful work
3. Excellent distribution platform

## Tactics
Use 3-5x daily
The purpose of these tactics are to minimize the gap between what I want (goal) and what is true (reality).

Conscious
- **Gather data** to learn: from self via ssm, primary research online, and [[Principles book#Weight decisions by believability|secondary research from qualified people]]. ^3bfbe2
	- Output: essential learnings, weighted in believability.
- **Self-socratic method (ssm)** to learn + decide: ask myself a bunch of questions diving 3-5 levels deep.  ^e9b8a9
	- Output: surfaces important realizations, unknown areas, decisions or actions to take
	- Consider [[my axioms]]
- **Constraint** algorithms to scope learning + decision
	- **[[Decision-making cheat sheet#People constraints|People constraints]]**, **[[Decision-making cheat sheet#Culture constraints|Culture constraints]]**, **[[Decision-making cheat sheet#Situation constraints|Situation constraints]]**, **[[Decision-making cheat sheet#System environment constraints|System constraints]]**
- **[[Decision-making cheat sheet#^91cfec|Context-specific algorithms]]** to reduce decision space 
- **[[Principles book#5 steps 287|5 step process]]**: GPDDD. Goal, Problem, Diagnose, Design, Do ^3823ac
	- **[[Principles book#Drill down technique 776|Drilldown technique]]** for steps 2-5: LICE. List problems, Identify root causes, Create plan, Execute plan
	- Alternative method: **[4 step process (Heath)](https://litfl.com/wrap-decision-making-approach)**: WRAP. Widen, Reality test, Attain distance, Prepare to be wrong ^3b17a0

Decisions = learn + decide

Sub-conscious
- **[Full body yes](https://conscious.is/concepts/leading-and-living-from-your-whole-body-yes)**: sometimes a problem isn't fully explainable. This is a way to be in touch with that.
	- Full body yes requires unblocked channels for full effectiveness

---
## Algorithms
Given some input, give an output.
[[my axioms]] are the programming language and global variables.

### Constraints for evaluating under uncertainty #r
Sources of uncertainty are outcome, model, state, and interaction. [[CS238 - Decision making under uncertainty|(Kochendorfer 2)]]

Constraints allow easier evaluation of sources of uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty should be evaluated independently of one another.

ref [[my axioms]] and [[Principles book]]

#### People
^53ed1c
Intention: accurately evaluate whether a person fits a function. 

Evaluate person for outcome, model, and interaction uncertainty. State uncertainty is outside scope.

Consecutive line of thinking to determine:

1. Action (outcome)
- **What range of action do I need from this person? From minimum to exceeds expectation.**
- Have they done the range of action before, and do they have logical cause-effect explanations for their conclusions? ([[Principles book#Weight decisions by believability|are they believable]])
- Can I visualize them doing this range of action? 
- Can other people closer to them and/or experienced in these actions visualize them doing this range of action?
- What certainty level do I have in these visualizations?-- How effective is this person's mental map for the action range? (interaction independent)
- How is this person's humility? 

2. Shared context windows (interaction)
- **Are our [[my axioms]] overlapping?**
	- The person may be effective in some situations, but if they and I do not have shared windows, this will lead to ineffectiveness.
	- Ask questions to evaluate
- Can I visualize them interacting well with other team members? (outcome independent)
	- Do other team members interact well with them? 

3. Thought & incentives (model)
- **What is the main incentive for this person to take this range of action?**  
- **Which step in the [[Principles book#5 steps 287|5 steps]] is this person especially good at and why?** (interaction independent)
- **What is the one big step in the [[Principles book#5 steps 287|5 steps]] that stands in their way of success and why?** (interaction independent)
- Do their good & bad steps complement mine? 
- What is this person's enneagram and big 5?

informs [[Decision-making cheat sheet#System constraints]]
ref: [[Principles book#Applied to people]]

#### Culture
Intention: build an effective and healthy culture that fits a function.

Culture is how a group of people think and act.

- Do work [[my axioms]] overlap with each team members' life principles?
- Based on this group of people, can I visualize that they are (1) fulfilling organization's intention, (2) fulfilled in their work working here for the next 1-2 years, and (3) collectively making each other stronger towards the organization's intention?
- Full-body yes + values: When I think about each desired cultural value of the company in relation to this person, do I feel a full-body yes? 

informs [[Decision-making cheat sheet#System constraints]]
ref [[Principles book#Applied to culture]]
todo: add uncertainty source

#### Environment
Intention: understand and be ready for possible outcomes given in-person interaction, email, public post, etc.

A situation is any state where someone, usually me, interacts with an environment. An environment includes other people.

Evaluate a situation based on state uncertainty.

State
- **What is the single desired output for a situation?**
- What are the expected inputs going into this situation?
- What is my certainty of desired inputs going into the situation? Undesired?
- What is my certainty of desired output given set of inputs?
- What emotional intent do I want to convey?
- What are backup outputs B and C if output A does not occur?
- What is the cost of each input into the situation? 
- What is the worst case scenario that could happen + its probability? low/med/high
- What is the best case scenario that could happen + its probability? low/med/high

#### System
Intentions: ([[self]])
1. Build an effective and healthy top organization
2. Build products that reach millions of people

An [[Organization]] is a machine with culture and people.
A [[product]] is art distributed.
An organization and a product are both systems. 

Outcome
- **Can I imagine a single desired + repeatable input and output going through this system? (e2e test)**
- Can I break down the system and imagine each piece working independently for an input and output? (unit test)
- Can I imagine that each combination of pieces work together even better than independently? (integration test)
	- Notice that complexity exponentially increases with every added piece.

todo: model, state, interaction uncertainties

### Methods of learning #r
- 1-1 instruction (most potent)
- Deep focus 1 at a time, long periods of time. 
- High expectations
- Frequent assessment of learnings
- Apply learnings to practical problem

##### Assess a person's expertise in a field
1. Define what input and outputs to expect from this person. See [[Decision-making cheat sheet#People|People section]]
2. Talk to 3 experts in the field who have done those inputs to outputs before
3. Ask them what questions they'd ask and responses they'd expect from another person that can do that
4. Ask those questions to the person

### Context-specific

#### Manage people #o
- **1-1s** ^ea8b0f
	- Start with 3 questions deep
	- Structure every 1-1. [Ask these questions](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1579121739186872320?s=46&t=PrLWmbH5vc4JSFAi5f6ccg) to show I want them to get to their highest potential, they have great ideas, and I care about them
		- How are you feeling about life at work?
		- How are you feeling about your work from home setup?
		- How are we performing as a company?
		- What is it like working with the rest of the team?
		- What is it like to work with me?
		- Go through Asana tasks. Past week, future week. (to gauge performance. They will know how they're doing)
		- Scale. 1 3 5. Couldn't be worse, meeting expectations, couldn't be better.
		- *Follow up q for each q: what would it take to get to the next level?*
- **Daily Standup**
	- Intention: Align everyone on path and surface issues in achieving speed/direction
	- Ask: **Are we on track with metrics?**
	- Check art: ([[An engine to build a massively scalable application#What I suspect to be winning formula]])
		 1. Is model is fast and accurate enough for use case? @derek @reinier @rob
		 2. Is extension effortless integrated with user's day, with balance of Joe Bidening but not too annoying? @kevin @clara
		 3. Does our interface have less clicks than existing option? @kevin @clara
		 4. Is referral easy for user to refer lots of other users? @kevin @clara
	5. Check distribution:
		1. Are we reaching enough views? @mar
		2. Are we reaching enough signups? @mar
		3. Are we engaging in a lovely way with users? @facu
		4. Are users compelled to be retained as users? @nancy ^be4fe5 ^5e67e4 ^ca09af
	- If no, why? 
		- What can we do *today* to fix this?
	- If yes, why? 
	- Actions
- **Hire**  ^0403cd
![[Screenshot 2024-08-11 at 8.11.45 PM.png]]

	- Define job function
		- Talk to people who've hired who I want to hire before. 
			- Cold reachout to these people if necessary. Identify them first. Ask them key questions. (see disrupt or die book)
	- Set intention and time: allocate time to hire. 40 hours over a month. We can scope this efficiently into <40 hours, 1 month to find the right person.  
	- Determine expected people, culture constraints that apply there
	- Identify 5 ideal candidates (3 hours)
	- Run tight interview process so it takes no longer than 1 week for the candidate. (20 hours)
		- Set up initial candidates all at once. In like 4 days. Run a tight process
		- First interview is with me. determine if they meet people and culture constraints. Line of question for each culture piece
		- Give them a project.
		- Another interview is with a teammate to review the project.
		- Another interview is with a domain expert. 
		- Reference checks. 1 back-channel check. 
	- Reference Call
		- Say we hire them. If there was 1 thing that you see could be the reason they don't work out, what would it be?
		- Culture questions (see below)
			- What's the hardest you've ever seen this person work? 
		- What do you sense is a core motivator for them? 
		- What is their family like? 
- Find a co-collaborator ^d3a76d
	- Someone who is near-equal footing
		- Do they complement my strengths and weaknesses on a personality level?
		- Can we bounce ideas off each other well? Are my and their energetic strengths amplified and encouraged?
		- I can see them growing into the role we'd need them to be  in 3 yrs
		- They've put in their 10,000 hours in the function that they're going to be working on (think: Mark Zuck, Bill Gates, Steve Woz who put in their hours)
	- Figure out whether they are:
		- Hard working - Do they work really fucking hard? 12-14 hour days out of passion + habit
		- 95%+ conscientious. If not, do they make up for it in ingenuity?
		- Evidence-minded
		- High integrity 
		- Considerate about the masses (personal ownership of data & privacy is a human right)
		- Optimistic
	- **Cofounder:** When I think of my person, my cofounder, and I think of someone who will handle the biz side, who...
		- Has a good relationship with family 
		- Meditates
		- Really keen with people 
		- Stable
		- High on the Influence scale
		- Works as hard as me
		- Good taste for words and images
		- Good with money numbers
		- Detail oriented
- Firing https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-when-how-to-fire-employee-at

#### Culture #o
- Culture interview ^fa785c
	- Ask a question / line of questioning per item here:
		- Fights for the pack.
		- Desire for excellence with understanding of constraints 
		- Scientific fundamentals in order to predict reality
		- Willing to work really fucking hard. Has been deeply obsessed about something before, [really care, see this line of questioning](https://alexw.substack.com/p/hire#:~:text=I%20have%20a,always%20worth%20it.) (tenacious)
			- They care about Viva (mission, product, problem)
				- If this were the last thing you worked on for the next 2 years would this be it?
			- They care about their work in general.
		- In tune with excitement & play (creative but a bit more)

#### Networking #o
- Have intention with every interaction.
- With every interaction, give them value
- Reach out to folks
	- Follow up. Each followup gives them some value
- Send useful info to folks

### Distribution #p
This is about [[distribute|distributing]] some object or idea to a wider network. 
1. Determine end goal for user, # of users intended to reach, and vibe
2. What's the overall reach?
3. What's the conversion at each step of the way?
4. What's the vibe for this channel?
5. Are 1 and 2/3/4 aligned?

### Thoughtful questions to ask any person
1. 

## Engines
[[Execution engines & learning areas#Learning areas & Engines]]

---

## Building blocks from most to least certain
The higher the level of certainty, the less energy expended to come to a decision.

- **Logic**: can use solely logic if variables are airtight conviction T/F
	- This is also a method to get to a point 
	- Tip: store a set of foundational truths and my [[my axioms]]. Assume with full certainty they are true/false given some prior that I think is unlikely to change change.
	- Proofs, guarantees
- **Probability / Statistics**
	- Useful in cases where variable accuracy is untrue 
	- Bayesian thinking
	- Subblocks
		- Computational lens: decisions from a computational standpoint. Includes AI.
			- requires obscene amounts of data
- **Correlative** 
	- Requires lots of data to be valid. significant *n*
	- Cons: very context-specific to situation it was tested in. low certainty it's reproducible
	- Heuristics (induction? deduction? deduction is a step up?)
	- Subblocks
		- Monte Carlo - Broad class of algorithms to random sample to obtain numerical results 
- **First person observation**
	- Cons: wouldn't expect it to be reproducible most of the time. Relies heavily on human intuition / human as the instrument.
	- Internal. Intuition-based
	- Subblocks
		- [Full-body yes](https://conscious.is/concepts/leading-and-living-from-your-whole-body-yes): requires clear channels for myself to receive a truthful answer from  higher beings

### Engines

Past principles -> algorithms, what about algorithms -> engines?? Engines for many different things and this is how I can get really, really good at many different things, executing them and having a base to fall back on.
Engines for
- social media fame
- [[my opwdri skill tree#^c00f5a]]
	- Network
	- Ai/nlp
	- product design
	- Hire
		- Convince anyone to join a team
	- culture
- Build a chrome extension
- unit economics + at scale. Calculate 


I'm going to try the idea of this engine out for 2.5 months. Can I get to [[decisions]] 0.0001% faster than I thought? Certainly of 1 in a million, that's 300 people in the US. There are probably more than 300 people in the US who think so robustly about decisions - so there's that. The other question is whether their mental model vs mine is *more effective* for bridging the gap btwn desire and reality.
I'm on the right track though. This method is complex and requires big effort to build, but it is a large wide robust foundation 

## More realities
- attitudes are contagious. We reflect off of each other in indras net

# more axioms

### 1. Act quickly & effectively
Be a lioness
2. If it is approached as easy, it becomes easy.
	1. Why? It unblocks flow within self and this spreads to unblock flows throughout the network
3. Avoid paths with low+ probability for big bad outcomes. Be ok with med/hi probability of small bad outcomes depending on high potential reward.
	1. Take as many low cost high reward swings. Most will probs be low probability reward but even better to spot the high probability ones
	2. Take caution with high probability of high negative reward swings, even if the high positive reward potential looks appealing 
4. Take a sufficient # of bets, all towards reaching a goal, to be able to get an even greater probability in being able to reach that goal.  
	1. Ex: multiple channels to market Viva
5. Move fast
	1. On decisions where there is nothing further to be learned from waiting
	2. On big opps
	3. Can I do the same thing in half the time? What's the difference btwn path 1 & 2 in substance
4. Be so good they can't ignore you.

### 2. Learn truth
1. Do not fear the truth.
2. Build broad framework quickly, then dive deep into specific areas of interest
3. Take advice only from people I'd switch places with for the specific item I'm receiving advice on. Ideally, I'd switch places with them broadly, we have shared [[my axioms]], & they've done it before. 
4. I'm not entitled to have opinions about a subject unless I can state arguments about a position better than  opposing party. -Munger

### 3. Deliver Value
1. Seek value for the collective over the self.
2. Seek mutual value creation.
	1. Diversify value created. 20% is giving without expecting anything in return. 20% is receiving without expecting anything returned. 60% is some exchange of value.
	3. Every action I do creates value.
	4. Seek to impart value to other nodes with each interaction.
3. Offer a solution whenever mentioning a problem.
4. Golden rule: Deliver to the world what I would buy if I were on the other end of it. -Munger

### 4. Give
1. Give people emotional gifts they yearn for and they will sing songs about you for generations
2. Give people logical, repeatable processes that deliver results and you'll be embedded in the fabric of society for generations 

### 5. Create
1. Play in the spaces between.
2. Impart emotional states of kindness and joy.
3. Start inwards and move outwards.  
4. When planning, think about plans B and C too.

### 6. Scale
1. Create as a vehicle to scale.
	1. coding writing art
2. Try to make something as useful/gifting as possible to as many people as possible...and worry about monetizing only when needed to sustain the spread.(This plays to my strengths anyways)
3.  Build something that outlasts me
4. Don't be afraid of power and the cost that comes with it. (Treatment from others, good and bad)

### 7. Have Standards
1. I want to be first. Top 5 of the century is okay too. 
2. The best creations come where I'm most intensely interested.
3. Keep my promises.

### 8. How the world works
1. Incentives rule. Agreeableness is overrated.
2. Substance wins over form.
3. Minimize gap between what I want and what is reality. 
4. Humans hallucinate stories that become reality.
5. Be careful of the self referential loop.

### 9. Connect with others
1. “People will do anything for those who…
	1.  Encourage their dreams,
	2.  Justify their failures,
	3.  Allay their fears,
	4.  Confirm their suspicions and
	5.  Help them throw rocks at their enemies.” - [[learning scratchpad/1-sentence persuasion|Warren]]
2. The above applies to text, speech, and actions. 
3. "The time to focus on your own hopes, dreams and desires is when you’re alone. This is when you should get clear on what you hope to accomplish, on what you would like to occur, in any given encounter. But once you get this state of clarity and find yourself face to face with another, place your attention where it can have the greatest impact. Place it on the other person." - [[learning scratchpad/1-sentence persuasion|Warren]]
	1. With each word spoken or written to another node, am I conveying one of the intentions above to this person? Or am I simply expressing myself without care for the other person?
	2. My expressions of self can come during my own introspection time and through my work.

### 10. Know who to work with
1. Don't tolerate ambivalence.
2. Don't tolerate lack of excellence.
3. Don't tolerate ambiguity in defining what excellence is in which contexts. 
4. Don't tolerate anti-work rhetoric.
