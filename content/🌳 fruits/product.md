Product is the happy marriage between [[art|creating art]]  and [[distribute|distributing it]]. 

A good product fulfills desires of people outside of the self.

A good product considers two factors: frequency of use and impact per use. 

---

## Simple process 
Prerequisite: have the [[tool|tools]] & understand the tools

- Create [[art]] (self) (make with tools that have constraints)
- See it resonate w other nodes 
- Distribute it

Rinse & repeat with feature releases or new products.
Good vibes throughout. 
Treat each step independently.
Art design distribute
[[my axioms]] are applied at each step.

## Misc.

- On quick information retrieval without relying on another tool
	- How might we quickly retrieve information without opening up an app?

- Importance of what is being built: **(Utility - Current state of the art) * # of People affected**

- Oftentimes engineers will place more importance towards creating art rather than distributing it. This is the reason engineers discount salespeople. It is true that resources dedicated to distribution are resources that do not improve the experience of a user using the product itself. 
	- Yet there is still an extremely large value to being able to distribute effectively

- On scaling teams
	- The Keeper Test: “If a person on your team were to quit tomorrow, would you try to change their mind? Or would you accept their resignation, perhaps with a little relief? If the latter, you should give them a severance package now, and look for a star, someone you would fight to keep” (p. 171).

- [Low floor high ceiling](https://jolibois.substack.com/p/low-floor-high-ceiling)
- low floor = simple starting point
- ceiling = room for a task to grow
- [Lower floors and raise ceilings from a teacher's perspective](https://www.byrdseed.com/to-differentiate-lower-floors-and-raise-ceilings/)
	- Aim for low ceiling, high floor
	- ""**You can always scaffold down** (this is what teachers are good at!) – but you can’t always raise the ceiling."
		- "Plan for your highest-ability students _first_, then figure out how to onboard your other learners." 
		- When you aim high and scaffold down, **it gives everyone an opportunity to go somewhere interesting.** You never know who will take advantage of that high ceiling. Kids will surprise you.
		- We just scaffold the real thing down as needed – and remove scaffolds as soon as possible.
			- That last part is key! **Scaffolds are designed to be removed.**
	- When we **offer a high ceiling to all of our students**, we open the door for unexpected students to go further than we might have expected.
	- Develop tasks that all students can get started with but also scale up for students who are ready for more. **This is _the easiest way_ to differentiate.**
	- High Ceiling, but High Floor (👎): your kids will struggle to even get started.
	- [Write problems that require a simple first step but which stretch for miles.](https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2012/ten-design-principles-for-engaging-math-tasks/)
	- low floor, high ceilings, [wide walls](https://johnumekubo.com/2017/11/09/low-floors-high-ceilings-and-wide-walls/) - wide walls are high range of horizontal growth
