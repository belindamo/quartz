## What is Just An Experiment?

I'm playing around with some cute little projects. Source code is [on Github](https://github.com/justanexperiment). These experiment proposals and write-ups are related to those projects, though there is also writing on here correlated to projects where the code has not been released or written yet. 

## Research proposals
These are proposals that I've been working on:

- [[Back-translation for Alignment of LLM Generation of Code, Tests, and more]]
- [[Crowdsourcing a Universal Browser Automation Task Graph with Continuously Running Tests]]
- [[AI Theorem Proving for International Math Olympiad Problems]]
- [["LLM Operating System"]]
- [[Explainable Protocols for 2x+ Retention Improvements to Human Long-Term Memory]]

More bite-sized experiments:
- [[What does a better knowledge graph structure for enhancing human learning alongside LLMs look like?]]
- [[What does an configurable format for a single AI agent's profile look like?]]
- [[🧪/Experiment Proposals/What does a configurable format look like to represent essential data for a single person?|What does a configurable format look like to represent essential data for a single person?]]

## 🧪 Experiment write-ups
These are the write-ups for the experiments hosted on https://justanexperiment.com. 

Note that all write-ups were created by running my written notes through ChatGPT.
