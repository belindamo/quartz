## What is Just An Experiment?

I host cute little projects on https://justanexperiment.com. These experiment proposals and write-ups are related to those projects, though there is also writing on here correlated to projects where the code has not been released or written yet. 

Enjoy reading :) You can navigate this blog through the inline links ([[product|like this]]), left navigation menu (large screens only), or the graph view / backlinks at the bottom. 

🤸🏻‍♀️ 🤸🏻‍♀️ 🤸🏻‍♀️

## Proposals
These are proposals that I've been working on:

- [[Back-translation for Alignment of LLM Generation of Code, Tests, and more]]
- [[Crowdsourcing a Universal Browser Automation Task Graph with Continuously Running Tests]]
- [[Explainable Data Structures  & Protocols  for 2x+ Retention Improvements to Human Long-Term Memory]]
- [[AI Theorem Proving for International Math Olympiad Problems]]
- [["LLM Operating System"]]

More bite-sized experiment proposals:
- [[What does a better knowledge graph structure for enhancing human learning alongside LLMs look like?]]
- [[What does an configurable format for a single AI agent's profile look like?]]
- [[🧪/Experiment Proposals/What does a configurable format look like to represent essential data for a single person?|What does a configurable format look like to represent essential data for a single person?]]

## 🧪 Experiment write-ups
These are the write-ups for the experiments hosted on https://justanexperiment.com.
