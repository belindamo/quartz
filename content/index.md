Hi! I'm a master's student at Stanford. I'm interested in model evaluations, agentic interfaces to accelerate learning, and graphs.

Previously I founded a live translation startup, Viva Translate, that had over 45,000 users and was backed by General Catalyst, AIX Ventures, and others. I'd also worked a smattering of jobs as a software engineer at Google, English teacher, and e-commerce store owner. Nowadays I'm pretty excited about building open source software. 

You can navigate this blog through inline links [[product|like this]], the left navigation menu on desktop, or the graph view at the bottom.
