According to Hofstadter, strange loops take form in human consciousness as...
?
the complexity of active symbols in the brain inevitably leads to the same kind of self-reference which [Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del "Kurt Gödel") proved was inherent in any sufficiently complex logical or arithmetical system in his incompleteness theorem. [1]
Hofstadter argues that the psychological self arises out of a similar kind of paradox. The brain is not born with an "I" – the [ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_(Freudian) "Ego (Freudian)") emerges only gradually as experience shapes the brain's dense web of active symbols into a tapestry rich and complex enough to begin [twisting back upon itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference"). According to this view, the psychological "I" is a narrative fiction, something created only from intake of symbolic data and the brain's ability to create stories about itself from that data. The consequence is that a self-perspective is a culmination of a unique pattern of symbolic activity in the brain, which suggests that the pattern of symbolic activity that makes identity, that constitutes subjectivity, can be replicated within the brains of others, and likely even in [artificial brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_brain "Artificial brain").
