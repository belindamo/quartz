### Notes


Men who excelled in these six arts were thought to have reached the state of perfection, becoming a [perfect gentleman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junzi "Junzi").

Western astronomical expertise (see [Jesuit China missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_China_missions "Jesuit China missions")) was welcomed as an aftermath of Chinese interest in astronomy and mathematics, partially formulated in the classical Six Arts agenda.
