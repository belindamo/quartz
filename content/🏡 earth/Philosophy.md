# Various philosophies on living

a belief that starts from the premise that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living things because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things."

What does Kafkaesque mean?
?
Anything kafkaesque is¬†**strange, nightmarish, often unnecessarily bureaucratic/complicated**. If you said your long, frustrating, and bizarre experience at the Department of Motor Vehicles was kafkaesque, you wouldn't be the first person to describe it that way.
