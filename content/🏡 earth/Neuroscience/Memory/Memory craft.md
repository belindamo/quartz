- Memory, writing, and technology can all enhance each other
- Native Americans used song lines. Long treks. Each stopping point had a song, physical ritual, etc. it was an encyclopedia. And access more info w the physical ritual 
- Big picture allows for hooks that get you really curious to learn more about the hooks (re:countries)
- Someone memorized 100,000
- Memory theater to represent the knowledge of the universe. (Camilo) https://socks-studio.com/2019/03/03/spatializing-knowledge-giulio-camillos-theatre-of-memory-1519-1544/

	- Could recall anything if he remembered the location he remembered it in
	- Vivid images, Language: syllables, math formula: story LinkedIn each symbol in formula
	- Issue: not observing number patterns (1234 etc) if memorized using the method
- Everything should have a name
	- Journey's names. Each location's name.
- Indigenous memory techniques use song and dance
	- There is no dichotomy between metaphors/myths and facts
	- If it is memorable good, stirs emotion great, conveys knowledge best

### My hot takes
Key question: how to encourage critical thinking and problem solving as is related to information in memory palaces?

Try
- running worksheet of places to convert 
	- I prefer indoor spaces 

Concerns
- Applied use of items in memory place
- Memory limit? 100k loci
- Frequency to revisit?

## how to prevent 
#todo: review this https://mullenmemory.com/memory-palace/do-memory-palaces-hinder-learning for how to prevent hindrances of learning with memory palaces
**1. *Don't encode everything using images*:**
**2. Choose loci as you learn & use the palace to help you structure the material:**
**3. Use spaced repetition & practice testing:**
