From Nielsen's experience, what is the average time it takes to do one review of a card using Anki's spaced repetition system?
?
The average time it takes to review a card using Anki's spaced repetition system is about 8 seconds.

From Nielsen's experience, what is his average interval between reviews for an Anki card, long term?
?
The average interval between reviews for an Anki card is currently 1.2 years, and rising.

From Nielsen's personal experience, what is the total review time is estimated for an average card over 20 years using Anki's spaced repetition system?
?
For an average card, it is estimated that 5 to 7 minutes of total review time will be needed over the entire 20 years.

According to Nielsen, what are the two rules of thumb for deciding to add a spaced repetition card?
?
1. If memorizing a fact seems worth 10 minutes of future time, then it is done.
2. If a fact seems striking then add it, regardless of whether it seems worth 10 minutes of future time or not.

For Nielsen, how long does it take to keep up with card review in Anki on a daily basis?
?
When keeping up with card review, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes per day.

What is the method of syntopic reading?
?
Syntopic reading is reading many materials on the same subject and comparing and contrasting the knowledge in them. It is used to build an understanding of an entire literature; what's been done, what's not yet been done.

What is the importance of adding caveats in spaced repetition notecards?
?
Adding caveats in the notecards generated is important for indicating the certainty of information and the reliability of a source.

What is the difference between procedural and declarative memory?
?
Procedural memory is the memory of how to do things, it requires practice to internalize. Declarative memory is the memory of facts and events, it can be easily stated or described.

According to Nielsen, what is the key learning assertion about memory of the basics?
?
The key learning assertion about memory of the basics is that it is often the single largest barrier to understanding. If people focused more on remembering the basics, they would find the high-level issues took care of themselves.

What is a chunk in the context of memory and learning?
?
A chunk is a basic unit of working memory. It is a combination of pieces that are recognized as a unit, and are able to be reasoned about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces.

# Notes

- calculation if it takes 8 sec to review a card
	- . On average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years, I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours for each card.
	- By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal set of Anki cards the average interval between reviews is currently 1.2 years, and rising. In an [appendix](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html#Anki_analysis) below I estimate that for an average card, I'll only need 4 to 7 minutes of total review time over the entire 20 years. Those estimates allow for occasional failed reviews, resetting the time interval. That's a factor of more than 20 in savings over the more than 2 hours required with conventional flashcards.
	- **thought: what does this look like if you are to learn from childhood? how much time today do we already spend on learning a topic? how long would that look like to learn a topic if you used spaced repetition + LLM + visualizations/other sensory cues? X hours vs Y hours. It is a simple mathematical calculations**
	- **thought: even as an adult, how would this look?**
	- [analysis](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html#:~:text=Appendix%201%3A%20analysis%20of%20Anki%20study%20time)
- I therefore have two rules of thumb. First, if memorizing a fact seems worth 10 minutes of my time in the future, then I do it** I first saw an analysis along these lines in Gwern Branwen's review of spaced repetition: Gwern Branwen, [Spaced-Repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition). His numbers are slightly more optimistic than mine – he arrives at a 5-minute rule of thumb, rather than 10 minutes – but broadly consistent. Branwen's analysis is based, in turn, on an analysis in: Piotr Wozniak, [Theoretical aspects of spaced repetition in learning](http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm).. Second, and superseding the first, if a fact seems striking then into Anki it goes, regardless of whether it seems worth 10 minutes of my future time or not. The reason for the exception is that many of the most important things we know are things we're not sure are going to be important, but which our intuitions tell us matter. This doesn't mean we should memorize everything. But it's worth cultivating taste in what to memorize.
- anki - learn from papers and books; to learn from talks and conferences; to help recall interesting things learned in conversation; and to remember key observations made while doing my everyday work.
	- I've used Anki to create a little over 10,000 cards over about 2 and a half years of regular use. That includes a 7-month break when I made very few new cards.
	- When I'm keeping up with my card review, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes per day. If it routinely rises to much more than 20 minutes it usually means I'm adding cards too rapidly, and need to slow down.
- reading a paper
	- identify the most important ideas in the paper. names of key techniques, looking for basic facts to understand and benefit from, basic terminology, rules, etc.
		- ex: what's the size of a go board?, who plays first in go?, where did alphago get its training data, names of the 2 main types of neural networks alphago used? (personally idk if i'd spend 10 min of my life learning each of these lmao?)
- his rules of thumb for other types of materials like **APIs, books, videos, seminars, conversations, the web, events, and places**
	- For instance, for seminars I try to find at least three high-quality questions to Ankify. For extended conversations, at least one high-quality question to Ankify. I've found that setting quotas helps me pay more attention, especially during seminars.
	- I'm more haphazard about videos, events, and places. It'd be good to, say, systematically Ankify 3-5 questions after going on an outing or to a new restaurant, to help me remember the experience. I do this sometimes. But I haven't been that systematic
	- I tend to Ankify in real time as I read papers and books.
- it's most useful to use spaced repetition when used in service of some personal fascinating project! It's much easier to connect to the questions and answers emotionally, and caring makes a difference. 
- Ankify things that serve your long-term goals. <3 
	- In some measure we become what we remember, so we must be careful what we remember. Spaced repetition makes this especially true.
- It's important to add caveats in the notecards generated, about certainty of information and the reliability of a source. 
	- ex: "“Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?” (Answer: Jones 2011)"
- A nifty trick is adding visualizations to cards! 
	- ex: “Visualize the graph Jones 2011 made of the probability curves for physicists making their prizewinning discoveries by age 30 and 40”. and this gives a photo. this covers lots of interesting data in 1 card! 
	- I bet you could do this with the other senses too! touch, sound, video...
- for research, to get a picture of an entire field, he...
	- begins with a truly important paper. ideally, a paper establishing a result that got him interested in the field in the first place. thorough reading.
	- thorough reads of 3-10 other key papers in the field
	- interspersed, do shallower reads of a much larger number of less important though good papers. 10s of papers
- method: syntopic reading: reading many materials on the same subject and compare and contrast the knowledge in them. To build an understanding of an entire literature; what's been done, what's not yet been done
	- I start to identify open problems, questions that I'd personally like answered, but which don't yet seem to have been answered. I identify tricks, observations that seem pregnant with possibility, but whose import I don't yet know. And, sometimes, I identify what seem to me to be field-wide blind spots. I add questions about all these to Anki as well. In this way, Anki is a medium supporting my creative research. It has some shortcomings as such a medium, since it's not designed with supporting creative work in mind – it's not, for instance, equipped for lengthy, free-form exploration inside a scratch space. But even without being designed in such a way, it's helpful as a creative support.
- anki is usually most useful in new areas
- tip: break things up into atomic facts
	- if the q & a is hard to answer, refactor by breaking it down
- tip: no orphan questions. build rich hierarchies of interconnections and integrative connections
- tip: use 1 big deck instead of subdecks
	- Why? world isn't divided neatly into separated components
- tip: avoid y/n questions
- counterarg: aren't external memory aids enough?
	- But for creative work and for problem-solving there is something special about having an internalized understanding. It enables speed in associative thought, an ability to rapidly try out many combinations of ideas, and to intuit patterns, in ways not possible if you need to keep laboriously looking up information.
	-  thought experiment of a flute in which there is “a one-second delay between blowing a note and hearing it!” As they observe, this is “absurd”. In a similar way, certain types of thoughts are much easier to have when all the relevant kinds of understanding are held in mind.
- counterarg: if this is so useful, why isn't it more widely used?
	- well, it is used. in medicine
	- anki is kind of gross to use
	- most people don't really know to care about learning deeply and for the long term
	- science hasn't fullly caught up
		- there is lag time between experimenting that something is true and validating with robust science. this is exciting to me! 
		-   Such a balance is not easy to achieve. The human-computer interaction (HCI) community has tried to achieve it in the systems they build, not just for memory, but for augmenting human cognition in general. But I don't think it's worked so well. It seems to me that they've given up a lot of boldness and imagination and aspiration in their design** As an outsider, I'm aware this comment won't make me any friends within the HCI community. On the other hand, I don't think it does any good to be silent, either. When I look at major events within the community, such as the CHI conference, the overwhelming majority of papers seem timid when compared to early work on augmentation. It's telling that publishing conventional static papers (pdf, not even interactive JavaScript and HTML) is still so central to the field.. At the same time, they're not doing full-fledged cognitive science either – they're not developing a detailed understanding of the mind. Finding the right relationship between imaginative design and cognitive science is a core problem for work on augmentation, and it's not trivial.
- tip: it's a natural part of the process to prune questions as you review them. if they are no longer of interest, Marie-Kondo that shit, say thank you and let it go
	- *orphan questinons*: questions not closely related to anything else in my memory
- idea: you can put super personal information in there. 
	- ex: a (very short!) list of superficially charming and impressive colleagues who I would never work with, because I've consistently seen them treat other people badly. It's helpful to Ankify some details of that treatment, so I can clearly remember why that person should be avoided. This isn't the kind of information that is right to spread casually: I may have misinterpreted the other person's actions, or have misunderstood the context they were operating in. But it's personally useful for me to have in Anki.
	- He goes even further and stores shit like "Is {my friend} a vegan?" loll
- tip: use multiple variants of the "same" question.
	- ex: “What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?” And: “Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period 1980-2011?”
- Types of notecards:
	- mostly question-answer. 
	- some are "cloze", fill in the blank, which are good for testing on quotes! 
- Constructing the cards, i.e. encoding, helps with memory. 
- tip:  creating notecards to try to remember the feeling of doing the process? Of visualizing the process, feeling it in my body. interesting test...
	- procedural vs. declarative memory. master a process vs. remember a fact. different! you need to do the process to internalize it. 
- Transfer process from declarative -> procedural memory seems relatively straightforward. 
	- ex: In the case of the command line, I use it often enough that I have plenty of opportunities to make real use of my Ankified knowledge of the command line. Over time, that declarative knowledge is becoming procedural knowledge I routinely use in context.
- Names matter! 
	- they are how we query our brains in text
	- they're a foundation to build up a network of knowledge
	- also other representations also matter! images, sounds, etc.
- key learning assertion: "memory of the basics is often the single largest barrier to understanding." 
	- if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves.
	- why: common failure mode of learning technical subjects is not understanding basic notation/terminology and thinking it's because of something really complicated. (literally me in cme100)
- key learning assertion: masters in a field have more complex chunks cached in their brains
	- ex1: chess. chess master vs. beginner.  A beginner would see “a pawn here, a rook there”, and so on, a series of individual pieces. Masters, by contrast, saw much more elaborate “chunks”: combinations of pieces that they recognized as a unit, and were able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces. Simon estimated chess masters learn between 25,000 and 100,000 of these chunks during their training, and that learning the chunks was a key element in becoming a first-rate chess player.
	- ex2: top mathematicians have, through hard work, internalized many more complex mathematical chunks than ordinary humans. And what this means is that mathematical situations which seem very complex to the rest of us seem very simple to them. So it's not that they have a higher horsepower mind, in the sense of being able to deal with more complexity. Rather, their prior learning has given them better chunking abilities, and so situations most people would see as complex they see as simple, and they find it much easier to reason about.
	- tldr of this is lol, getting in a lot of reps to create complex chunks is super important
	- 1956 paper by George Miller, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”** George A. Miller, [The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/) (1956).. Miller argued that the capacity of working memory is roughly seven chunks.
	- chunk: basic unit of working memory
- caveat: memory is complicated so no current model covers all bases
- caveat: we don't understand why exponential decay of memory happens. Ebbinghaus's curve
	- depends sensitively on the type of material being memorized, on the exact time intervals, and many other variables.
	- we have enough understanding of memory to conclude that a system like Anki should help a lot. But many of the choices needed in the design of such a system must be made in an _ad hoc_ way, guided by intuition and unconfirmed hypotheses. The experiments in the scientific literature do _not_ yet justify those design choices. (as of 2018)

- what are my next steps to try?
	- calculate the time spent in learning a particular concept
	- calculate the different "chunks" and how long it takes to learn those particular more complex "chunks". can probably be done algorithmically
