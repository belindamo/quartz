stabilization curve >> this curve tells you how much you gain in memory stability when you actively retrieve memories, e.g. in spaced repetition
formula for stabilization curve
?
`SInc = SInc^MAx * e^(-Gain * R)`
where:
- SInc = stability increase. the ratio of memory  stability after and before the repetition
- SInc^Max = maximum possible increase in memory stability. It depends on current stability and memory complexity.
- Gain = constant to express the gain in stabilization with passing time. It is a measure of the spacing effect
- R = retrievability, or the expected probability of recall at a given point in time. Determined by the frogetting curve. 
Stabilization curve is the sibling to the [[forgetting curve]]. Wozniak claims it's the single most important curve in learning [1].
