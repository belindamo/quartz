godel's 2 incompleteness theorems are concerned with [[SR/memory/m37PtHbD.md|>>]] the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories.


Any system that can talk about itself and its own consistency is necessarily inconsistent.

**First Incompleteness Theorem** [[SR/memory/3Y79DuT7.md|>>]] "Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F." [1]


**Second Incompleteness Theorem** [[SR/memory/0irfybak.md|>>]] "Assume F is a consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic. Then F does not prove the consistency of F" [2]


True or False: Godel's first theorem shows there are truths that can't be proved. Explain
[[SR/memory/DKvmqK91.md|?]]
False. Incompleteness theorem doesn't deal with provability in an absolute sense, but rather the derivability in a specific formal system. Statement X may be unprovable in formal system A but provable in formal system B.


According to [Gödel’s incompleteness theorems](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#IncThe), the statement that Peano Arithmetic (PA) is consistent, in its guise as a number-theoretic statement (given the technique of [[godel numbering]])
[[SR/memory/G6wMxduj.md|?]]
cannot be derived in PA itself.
[[godel numbering]] is used to prove these theorems.

### Notes

1st theorem: not complete
1. any sentence can be represented w a godel number
2. any proof can be represented w a godel number
3. the proof referring to itself cannot be represented as a godel number
	1. g: there is no proof with the statement godel g

2nd: can't prove consistency


#### my hot takes
but...you kinda got to accept formal system of peano arithmetic, to accept godel numbering...
i just think a formal system itself is flawed...logical system...
