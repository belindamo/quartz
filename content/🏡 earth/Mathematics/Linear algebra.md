Derivatives are so cool


# Terms
- [[differentiation]]
- [[derivative]]
- [[partial derivative]]


 
 
 Intuitively:  knowing the instantaneous rate of change of _z_ relative to _y_ and that of _y_ relative to _x_ allows one to calculate the instantaneous rate of change of _z_ relative to _x_ as the product of the two rates of change
As put by [George F. Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Simmons "George F. Simmons"): "If a car travels twice as fast as a bicycle and the bicycle is four times as fast as a walking man, then the car travels `_____` as fast as the man."
