What is a **derivative** and intuitively, what useful info does it give you in the context of neural nets?
?
A derivative quantifies how sensitive a function's output is, with respect to its input.
Given y=f(x), if you add 1 to x, how drastically does y increase or decrease? It gives the relationships between variables.

derivative test
?
test that uses derivative of a function to see where its local min, local max, and saddle points are.
