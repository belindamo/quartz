Flashcards


Set Theory
?
Study of sets, which are collections of objects. It includes operations such as union and intersection, and covers concepts such as infinite sets and their implications on computing.
<!--SR:!2024-07-30,3,230-->

Direct Proof
?
A method of proving mathematical theorems by assuming a set of axioms and logically deducing a theorem directly from them.
<!--SR:!2024-08-04,6,250-->

Proof by Contradiction
?
Proof by contradiction involves assuming the opposite of what needs to be proved and showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction.
<!--SR:!2024-08-07,9,250--> 

Proof by Contrapositive
?
Proof by contrapositive involves proving that the negation of the conclusion implies the negation of the premise.
<!--SR:!2024-07-28,1,191-->

Propositional Logic
?
A branch of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying entire propositions, statements, or sentences to form more complicated propositions, statements, or sentences.
<!--SR:!2024-07-29,2,210-->

First-Order Logic
?
A formal system used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. It extends propositional logic with quantifiers and predicates that enable expressions involving elements of a specific domain.
logic over individual variables, not sets
<!--SR:!2024-07-28,1,190-->

Difference between first and second order logic
?
First-order logic (FOL) involves quantifying over individual variables and predicates. For example, it allows statements like "For all x, there exists a y such that x is related to y."
Second-order logic (SOL) extends this by allowing quantification over predicates and functions themselves, not just individual variables. For instance, it can quantify over sets or relations, as in "There exists a relation R such that for all x, R(x) holds."
In summary:
- **FOL**: Quantifies over individuals.
- **SOL**: Quantifies over predicates and functions.
<!--SR:!2024-07-28,2,231-->

Binary Relations
?
Binary relations involve pairs of elements from two sets which are related by some rule.
<!--SR:!2024-07-28,2,230--> 

Equivalence Relations
?
Equivalence relations are a special type of binary relation that are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.


Functions, Injections, Surjections, Bijections
?
Functions are mappings from elements of one set to another that are well-defined; injections (one-to-one functions), surjections (onto functions), and bijections (both one-to-one and onto).
<!--SR:!2024-07-30,3,230-->

Cardinality
?
Cardinality refers to the number of elements in a set, which can be finite or infinite.
<!--SR:!2024-07-30,3,230-->


Diagonalization

Diagonalization is a method used to prove the non-countability of certain sets, such as the real numbers.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,210-->


The Pigeonhole Principle

A principle that states if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.
<!--SR:!2024-08-07,12,280-->

Mathematical Induction

A mathematical technique used to prove a statement, theorem, or formula is true for every natural number.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Formal Language Theory, DFAs, NFAs

Study of abstract languages and automata, including deterministic (DFAs) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), used for recognizing patterns and structures in computer science.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,220-->

Regular Expressions, Equivalence of Regular Expressions and NFAs

Syntax used for specifying patterns to match sets of strings. Their equivalence to NFAs means any pattern that can be described by a regular expression can be recognized by some NFA, and vice versa.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Nonregular Languages

Languages that cannot be recognized by any finite automaton.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200--> 

The Myhill-Nerode Theorem

The Myhill-Nerode Theorem provides a method for proving a language is nonregular.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Context-Free Grammars, Context-Free Languages

A type of formal grammar which is used to generate all possible strings in a given formal language. Context-free languages are generated by context-free grammars.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Turing Machines, Designing Turing Machines

An abstract computational model that uses a tape and a head that moves left or right over the tape, which can model any computation.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

The Church-Turing Thesis
?
A hypothesis about the nature of computational functions that can be executed on a physical machine, stating that every function that can be computationally realized can be computed by a Turing machine.
<!--SR:!2024-07-28,2,220-->

R and RE Languages
?
R languages are recursive, decidable languages. RE languages are recursively enumerable, possibly undecidable.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200--> 

The Universal Turing Machine
?
A Universal Turing Machine can simulate any other Turing machine.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Self-Reference, Undecidability
?
Self-reference occurs in situations where statements or formulas refer to themselves. Undecidability implies no algorithm can determine the truth value of certain propositions in a system.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

Verifiers, Unrecognizability
?
Verifiers are algorithms that verify proofs of statements, where unrecognizability relates to the inability of an algorithm to decide whether given strings belong to a language.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

The P versus NP Question
?
A major unsolved problem in computer science concerning the relationship between two classes of problems, P (solvable in polynomial time) and NP (verifiable in polynomial time).
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->

NP-Completeness
?
A classification used to describe decision problems for which no efficient solving algorithm has been found. These problems are as difficult as the hardest problems in NP.
<!--SR:!2024-07-27,1,200-->
