- Set Theory
	- Study of sets, which are collections of objects. It includes operations such as union and intersection, and covers concepts such as infinite sets and their implications on computing.
- Direct Proof
	- A method of proving mathematical theorems by assuming a set of axioms and logically deducing a theorem directly from them.
	- if P then Q

- Proof by Contradiction
	- Proof by contradiction involves assuming the opposite of what needs to be proved and showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction
	- if not Q then contradiction

- Proof by Contrapositive
	- if not Q then not P
