### ch3

- 3 possible sources of uncertainty: 
	- inherent stochastiity: in system like subatomic particle movement. chaos
	- incomplete observability: game show, outcome is deterministic but contestant doesn't know that
	- incomplete modeling: not all necessary data is used or weighted correctly. like time step discretization
