(B, T, C) tensor
[[SR/memory/m3HLYuJ6.md|?]]
Batch (number of data samples processed in 1 roundtrip pass) by Time (sequence length) by Channel (embedding size)


B in (B, T, C) tensor
[[SR/memory/i9ZVSZMb.md|?]]
B: batch size, e.g. number of data samples processed in 1 forward/backward pass


T in (B, T, C) tensor
[[SR/memory/IFJEztJG.md|?]]
T: sequence length measured in time steps in a time series or positions in a sentence


C in (B, T, C) tensor
[[SR/memory/BI7txWQm.md|?]]
C: channel which is dimensionality of embedding
