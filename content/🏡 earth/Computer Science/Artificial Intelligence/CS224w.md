Graphs are a general language for >> describing and analyzing entities **with relations/interactions**

heterogeneous graph >> multiple types of node types, edges, relations

bipartite graph + an example >> graph that can be separated into 2 sets pointing to each other. like authors-to-papers

difficulty with using graphs >> they are of arbitrary size and complex topologically. which means search space is very high


What are the variables in a heterogenous graph? 
$$
G = (V,E,R,T)
$$

# Lecture notes

- 1- Intro
	- why they're exciting! **Graphs are a general language for describing and analyzing entities with relations/interactions**
	- prediction can happen at: edge, node, subgraph/community, or graph level
	- graphs can be directed or undirected
	- different kinds of graphs
		- heterogeneous graph - multiple types of nodes of node types, edges, relations
		- bipartite graph - can be separated into 2 sets pointing to each other. like authors-to-papers
	- potential problems to solve
		- in the past, neural networks have considered simple sequences and grids rather than complex graph structures
		- graphs are complex - arbitrary size and complex topologically
			- often dynamic and multimodal
			- no fixed node ordering or reference point
		- you can infer lots of missing info from a graph, through 
- 2 - Node embeddings
	- what are embeddings really?
