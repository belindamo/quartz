what is the singleton pattern?
?
The Singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
It is a well-known design patterns for how to solve recurring problems in object-oriented software
The key characteristics of the Singleton pattern are
- Ensuring a class has only one instance
- Providing easy access to that instance
- Controlling the instantiation of the class
Common use cases for the Singleton pattern include
- Controlling access to shared resources like databases or files
- Providing a global access point to an object
- Serving as a basis for other design patterns such as abstract factory, factory method, builder, and prototype
- Implementing facade objects, as often only one facade object is required
- Logging, as all objects writing log messages require a uniform point of access to a single log
However, the Singleton pattern is sometimes considered an anti-pattern due to its potential disadvantages, such as difficulty in unit testing and violation of the Single Responsibility Principle
