# Notes

The Progressive Web App Checklist describes what makes an app installable and usable by all users, regardless of size or input type.


## PWA Checklist
- Starts fast, stays fast 
	- Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online experience, because high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing ones. Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric performance metrics.
- Works in any browser
	- Users can use any browser they choose to access your web app before it's installed.
- Responsive to any screen size
	- Users can use your PWA on any screen size and all of the content is available at any viewport size.
- Provides a custom offline page
	- When users are offline, keeping them in your PWA provides a more seamless experience than dropping back to the default browser offline page.
- Is installable
	- Users who install or add apps to their device tend to engage with those apps more.

## Optimal
- Provides an offline experience
	- Where connectivity isn't strictly required, your app works the same offline as it does online.
- Is fully accessible
	- All user interactions pass [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) accessibility requirements.
- Can be discovered through search
	- Your PWA can be easily [discovered through search](https://web.dev/explore/discoverable).
- Works with any input type
	- Your PWA is equally usable with a mouse, a keyboard, a stylus, or touch.
- Provides context for permission requests
	- When asking permission to use powerful APIs, provide context and ask only when the API is needed.
- Follows best practices for healthy code
	- Keeping your codebase healthy makes it easier to meet your goals and deliver new features.
