With rough napkin math, computers in 2023 are at least 17 million times faster at computing deterministic functions than humans. 

Since the first substantial computer in 1946, the capabilities of a single unassisted computer to compute arithmetic with 100% accuracy, barring hardware issues, has exceeded that of any single unassisted human given the same amount of time. [2] While it remains unclear how to measure human compute and memory, based on empirical data it remains true since the ENIAC that any deterministic function that can be calculated by a human can be computed more quickly by a non-theoretical computer. 

Per Moore’s observation, compute capabilities have roughly doubled every two years since 1970. [1] From 1971 to 2019, commercial microprocessors have increased their number of transistors from approximately 2,300 to 39.54 billion. [6, 7] This means that microprocessors have increased their number of transistors by a factor of approximately 17 million.
