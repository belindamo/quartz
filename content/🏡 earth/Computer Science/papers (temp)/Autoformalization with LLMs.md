In **Autoformalization with LLMs (2022)**, the authors find this result about LLMs and auto-formalization >> LLMs can correctly translate a significant portion (25.3%) of math competition problems perfectly to formal specifications in Isabelle/HOL.

## Questions & Discussion Items
Process:
- Formalized 3,908 math problems, 3,363 were syntactically correct
- First iteration: 782 theorems proved (23.3% success rate)
- Second iteration: 1,011 theorems proved (30.1% success rate)


They used BLEU score for translation :o

%% TODO-rr: consider using BLEU score for translation btwn levels :o %%
