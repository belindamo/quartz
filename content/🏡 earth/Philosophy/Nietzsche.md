According to Nietzsche, what is considered good and bad?
?
"On the Genealogy of Morality," Nietzsche proposed that the original meaning of "good" was derived from the nobility and those with power, who considered their own actions and characteristics as good. On the other hand, "bad" was associated with the common or lowly people, who were seen as inferior.
Nietzsche also argued that the concepts of good and bad evolved over time. He suggested that the rise of slave morality, particularly with the advent of Christianity, led to a re-evaluation of these values. The "good" became associated with traits like humility, sympathy, and self-sacrifice, while "bad" was linked to characteristics like pride, selfishness, and power - traits that were once seen as good in the master morality.
However, Nietzsche was critical of this shift. He believed that it led to the denial of life-affirming instincts and the suppression of the will to power, which he saw as essential to life and creativity.
