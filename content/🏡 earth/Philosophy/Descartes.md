What is Descartes' wax argument? Recall the example with wax, and its significance.
?
Consider a piece of wax. It is from a hive, smells like honey and flowers.
However, when the wax is brought near a flame, these sensory characteristics change. The taste and smell evaporate, the color changes, the shape is lost. Yet, we still recognize that it is the same piece of wax.
The point being made is that our senses cannot be the only basis for understanding that the piece of wax remains the same. Our mind has a grasp of our environment via not only the senses, but through intellectual perception.

What is Descartes' Evil Demon thought experiment?
?
Imagine everything you perceive through your senses is controlled by an evil demon D. The demon D is dedicated to deceive you so that all senses you believe to be true are actually false.
However, the demon D cannot deceive you about 1 thing: your existence.
Even if you are being deceived, this demon D cannot deceive you about your own existence.
*This is post-wax argument and leads to conclusion Cogito, ergo sum*
*my counterpoints...well...the demon could deceive you about your existence if the thought experiment were different lmao. like, if the demon could deceive you.*

Explain Descarte's conclusion of *Cogito, ergo sum*, or *I think, therefore I am*.
?
It is a conclusion he reached if he were to doubt everything, including your own body and external world.
It is the fact that Descartes cannot doubt *that he is in the act of doubting*.
To doubt, you must think, and to think, you must exist.
*dubito ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum*
