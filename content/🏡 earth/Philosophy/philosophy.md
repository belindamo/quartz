Philosophy >> historically, encompasses all bodies of [[knowledge|knowledge]].
<!--LEARN:YN8XpHVx-->
I think it's quite hard to define this particular term because it is so high level. In my own conception of this, I believe philosophy encompasses any way of thinking, whether that's some religion or governing principles or [[üè° earth/Science/science|science]] or some subset of those concepts.
