### Notes

originates from europe

as opposed to analytic philosophy

Seems like it generally rejects that science is the only or most accurate way of understanding natural phenomena.
Various conditions can change the human experience

interestingly, 

In some cases (such as German idealism or phenomenology), this manifests as a renovation of the traditional view that philosophy is the first, foundational, _a priori_ science. In other cases (such as hermeneutics, critical theory, or structuralism), it is held that philosophy investigates a domain that is irreducibly cultural or practical. And some continental philosophers (such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, or the later [Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger")) doubt whether any conception of philosophy can coherently achieve its stated goals.
