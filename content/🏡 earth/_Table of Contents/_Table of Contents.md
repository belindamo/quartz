# Instructions
Concept Note type in ðŸŒ³: at the moment, this is just #concept  and the subtypes of concepts which are #concept-statement, #concept-question  and #concept-pamphlet. EVERY concept note should have only one of these
- #concept: e.g. title: `math`. Note that it is lowercase.
- #concept-statement: e.g. title: `Products are the happy marriage of art and distribution`
- #concept-question: e.g. title: `What does the architecture of a transformer look like?`
- #concept-pamphlet : e.g. title: `Fencing`. Note that it is uppercase. It's like a cheat sheet. It also operates like a MOC (Map of Content).

## What does a good Concept Note look like? 
**Concept Notes** are Notes that are in a structured format because I want to either **retrieve**, **reference**, or **memorize** them over time. They are atomic. These will typically avoid stream-of-thought notes in those in the `grow` and `daily` folders.

Ideally, every Concept Note should be structured as follows:

![[_/templates/concept]]

The fields are:
- Tags: show the note type
- Question / Answer pairs: for the flashcards
- Source(s): this may be either other notes or external links. External links should have some explanation if it is just url
- Notes: my notes on the topic, to provide context

## What's the purpose of highly structuring everything in this way? 
Being more detailed, the purpose is that I will be able to do the following:
- Have structured data that allows for increased speed/accuracy of **memory learning, retention, and retrieval**. 
	- This structured data can be used to:
		- Create spaced repetition flashcards
		- Create sense-based mnemonics. Usually they are visual-based.
	- This resulting memory system can be used for life-long retention.
- Have structured data that I can use as a base to eventually auto-generate learning graphs 
- Have structured data that is on the limits of human explainability
