Knowledge without kindness can be dangerous. My hope is to write this knowledge base kindly to myself, and therefore kindly to others. 

This base will be updated over time. 

## Setting my intentions
Acknowledging intention is super important because it is the filter used to add knowledge to this base. 

- Intentions: ^d30b39
	- Set a strong base of knowledge with most supported truths as low level blocks supporting the ones above
		- Paying respect to knowledge gatherers of the past
	- Record knowledge in a way that is easy to understand
		- Lots of examples
		- Only use words that a 10 year old can understand (except for node links)
		- Every node can be read independent of other nodes
		- Every sentence can be read independent of other sentences
		- Easy to review in 10 years and understand
		- It's clear why every node matters
		- First person is okay
	- Pursue truth
		- Be clear about certainty levels and personal filters
		- Use mostly reputable external sources (university sites and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/))
		- Have a clear and kind mental map that I feel good about referencing over my lifetime
	- Be kind
		- If I write in a kind way to myself, it will be kind to others


## Certainty levels
There are different tags for certainty level:
- #internal-c - boring and hot takes alike that are not researched. They are my lived experiences and observations
- #external-c - people whose judgement I trust on the topic generally agree 
- #science-c - some papers exist about this but the data is correlative or relatively new
- #science-2-c - this is statistically significant and well-researched by humans. e.g. gravity

Certainty levels are subject to my personal filter, so please consider them with a shake of pepper~

I'll try my best to make sure every node in this knowledge base has one of these tags! My hope is that over time, nodes move upwards in certainty level.

(I also don't really like the names so they'll probably be changed at some later point)
