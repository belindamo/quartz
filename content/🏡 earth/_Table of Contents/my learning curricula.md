- CS knowledge:
	- Operating Systems (e.g. Stanfordâ€™s CS111)
	- Reinforcement Learning ([CS234](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/))
	- NLP ([CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)) ðŸ’¬
	- Graph ML ([CS224w](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/))
	- Data Structures & Algorithms (CS161, [CS168](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/))
	- Probability (as in [CS109](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/) & [STATS116](https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats116/courseinfo.html), got an A but my understanding is shaky)
	- Applied [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-programs/statistics-minor) - which seems more fundamental than CS or [data science](https://datasciencemajor.stanford.edu/academics/data-science-minor) (Stats191)Â 
- Math
	- Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Vector Calculus (got Aâ€™s but want to get my understanding of this down pat)
	- First-order logic ([Phil 151](https://web.stanford.edu/~icard/phil151))
	- Beyond first-order logic ([src](https://builds.openlogicproject.org/content/first-order-logic/beyond/beyond.pdf))
	- Proof solving
	- Formal Systems
	- Godel and Turingâ€™s papers
- Phil
	- Wittgesteinâ€™s books
	- FLOP and other greens
	- art of war, book of 5 rings, 6 secret teachings

- Generalizable frameworks to revisit...
	- i think proof solving tactics....can be applied across
	- i think probability....can be applied across

### seminal readings
The ones that I feel are seminal....
- *Incompleteness Theorem*, Godel 1931
- *On Computable Numbers*, Turing 1950
- *Principia Mathematica*, Whitehead and Russell 1910
- *Tractatus Logico Philosophicus*, Wittgenstein 1921
- *Philosophical Investigations*, Wittgenstein 1953
- *Attention is All You Need*, 2017

Other books I'd like to read
- *Manufacturing Consent*, Chomsky and Herman 1988

Interesting ones
- Bret Victor's writings
- Chomsky's linguistic theories such as Chomsky hierarchy
- RLHF
- AgentGPT
- GEB
- Yates, The Art of Memory
- Russxell, Why I am Not a Christian
