Intention: Build internal machine where I can retrieve in under 3 sec and be confident in my thought process. 
Internal machine includes decision model, memory palace with spaced repetition

## Engines
This is different for learning for learning's sake becase engines are applied learning. 
Derived from [[my opwdri skill tree#opwdri]]

## What I want to learn
I think we start w fundamentals of mathematics and move onwards from there

Start from the basics. Ground up. Start w math and logic. 

- bayesian thinking
- all the stuff in decision making algorithms book
- tools
    - observable ones
        - emotional
        - scientific
            - ones to get highly effective results
            - computational
        - biases/fallacies
    - non-observable ones
        - non-observable philosophy
            - spiritual
- basics
	- science
	- scientific method
- strange loops (Level-crossing feedback loops)
    - Godel’s incompleteness theorem
    - theory of everything
- markov chains (decision making)
- Thesius ship
- Indra’s net
- Marr’s levels
- Cantor’s theorem
- Chinese room experiment
- eudaimonia
- Wittgenstein
- Hofstatder
-   dopamine
-   serotonin 

## Meta-learning
![[Decision-making cheat sheet#Methods of learning r]]
- Breadth first skeleton
- Depth first dives
- Speed of understanding reality
- Edging

- Breadth first - A broad level 0/1 understanding of how everything is related
- Depth first subjects - Subjects I want to have a snap unconscious understanding of upon prompting. This goes a few levels deeper

Next steps -  port over from 
- [ ] older Notion city map files
- [ ] of basic knowledge stuff that I've learned so far 
- [ ] scaffolding for future learnings
- [ ] easy to mental palace
- [ ] addresses primary areas of learning [[2022 - india trip + break#^5bdd8e]] that are based on [[my opwdri skill tree]] & [[self]]
