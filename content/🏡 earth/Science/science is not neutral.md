What does it mean that "science is not neutral"?
[[SR/memory/F1kdALEk.md|?]]
Research and science are not neutral because they embed values. 
Science and Technology Studies (STS) posits that what counts as a contribution, aka what is major vs. incremental, or even what counts as Computer Science, is socially constructed by the elites in the field. 
For example, not so long ago, HCI and Ethics were not seen as legitimate CS.
Also, not so long ago, CS itself was not seen as a legitimate field.
