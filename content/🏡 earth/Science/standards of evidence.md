?
standard of evidence
Standards of evidence:
- Medicine: Double-blind randomized controlled trial
- Philosophy: Rhetoric
- Math: Formal proof

In computing, because areas use different methods, the standard of evidence differs based on the area. 

Your goal: convince an expert in your area. So, use the methods appropriate to your area

### Notes

Each claim structure implies an evaluation design 
- x > y: given a representative task or set of tasks, test whether x in fact outperforms y at the problem
- ∃ x: demonstrate that your approach achieves x 
- bounding x: demonstrate bounds inside or outside of which approach x fails
