# Notes

[[A strange loop is a paradoxical level crossing feedback loop.]]

- "Creation of a thing and creation plus full understanding of a correct idea of the thing, are very often parts of one and the same indivisible process and cannot be separated without bringing the process to a stop. The process itself is not guided by a well defined programme and cannot be guide by such a programme for it contains the conditions for the realization of all possible programmes " - feyerabend, against method p.10



Thoughts: 
- We cannot escape the clutches of the empirical tools that we are born into. At the end of the day we filter through our 5 senses. It is impossible for a fish to know they are in water as it is all they've ever known.
- No clear divide between aesthetics and function.
	- E.g. style of a sentence vs. content of sentence. 
- Koen Japanese saying about answering a question on a completely different level. 'Where do I go to hem my skirt?' -> 'Moo'

Fun facts
- Karl Marx and Frederick Engels tried to prove their ideas via math to have unequivocal truth and therefore support
