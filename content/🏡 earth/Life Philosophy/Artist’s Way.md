#todo: Dropping down the well 

The technique of listening beyond the veil >> how to listen to the noises that we habitually tune out from, talking to others, listening more deeply, and not interrupting.

The idea of Blasting through Blocks >> it's a tool to undertake when you're procrastinating or when your fear has got you landlocked, or when your critic is loud.

The Believing Mirror is >> "somebody who reflects back to your strength, your courage, your positivity, your possibility, and they don't have a need to fix you. They just have a need to listen."
