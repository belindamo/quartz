## 5 steps (287)

5 steps of goal setting, according to ray dalio
?
GPDDD
1.  Have Clear goals.
2.  Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.
3.  Accurately Diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.
4.  Design plans that will get you around them.
5.  Do what’s Necessary to push these designs through to results.
Considerations for each step:
- Goal
	- The goal is audacious.
	- in line with [[my axioms]].
- Problem	
	- [[Principles, Ray Dalio#Drill down technique 776|Drill down technique]] starts here.
	- This step is where reality meets desire. 
- Diagnose 
	- [[Decision-making cheat sheet#^3bfbe2|Gather data]] from self via ssm, primary research online, and secondary research from qualified people.
		- Weight believability based on person. Have they done it before? See people constraints
	- Get to root cause.
- Design
	- Understand constraints to design an executable plan.
- Do
	- Execution requires conscientiousness.
	- Adaptability to do mini loops.
Historically I have been good at goal setting, okay at design and identifying problems, and not very good at not tolerating problems, diagnosing, and doing. 

See [[viva reflection#^642e35]] for self-evaluation

Evaluate each step independently.

To ponder: is there an even better way to do this according to scientific method? >> worry about this later, stick w this for now

Intent: try to iterate loop faster to set goals higher and higher

Compatible with [[Decision-making cheat sheet#^3b17a0|Heath's WRAP]]

## Other Problem solving techniques

### Invert idea / question
Invert idea/question >> What is the double negated way of presenting this question?

### Weight decisions by believability
Weight decisions by believability. The most believable opinions are those of people with these 2 characteristics >> 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that they can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions.

### Drill down technique (776)

Drill down technique
?
Use the following drill down technique to gain an 80/20 understanding of a department or sub-department that is having problems (492). Remember to consider steps independently.
1. List the problems, inventory all the core problems. Be specific. Name names. Don’t try to find solutions yet.
2. Identify the root causes. Keep asking “Why?”.
3. Create a plan that addresses the root causes.
4. Execute the plan and transparently track its progress.

Some questions on evaluating people
?
- **Which of the 5 steps is this person good at? What is their one big thing that stands in their way of success?**   ^e5216b
	- to fix the thing, either (1) have what you need yourself or (2) get it from others. 
	- Mental map + humility. [source](https://principles.app.link/qjKGaAUL6tb)
- What range am I willing to accept for a function?
- How is this person's mental map? For specific areas. 
- How is this person's humility?
- Visualize ranges of expectations I have of people

- [team dimensions profile](https://www.principles.com/principles/1c122828-1363-439b-8ff4-8a92a408e721/)
	- -   [Creators vs. refiners vs. advancers vs. executors vs. flexors.](https://www.principles.com/principles/1c122828-1363-439b-8ff4-8a92a408e721/)
- big 5
- [task vs goal oriented](https://www.principles.com/principles/ee3a7562-4dc2-439b-98c8-d2ced735c035/)
	- similar to intuitive vs sensing. 
	- task-oriented tends to be more reliable but blindsided by things. detail-oriented, harder to visualize big picture

## Evaluating culture

### Building an organization
According to dalio, an organization is a machine with >> culture & people (461)

In the best scenario, work principles are aligned with >> each members' life principles
