According to high output management, in knowledge-based work, everyone is a >> manager

A meeting is nothing less than the *medium* through which... >> managerial work is performed. This means we should not be fighting their very existence, but rather using the time spent in them as efficiently as possible" - p71

According to high output management, "Managers “leverage” their time by spending small amounts to have large impact through three activities: 
?
1) information gathering
2) decision making
3) “nudging” others." 
- High output management, Grove

According to high output management, there are 2 types of meetings:
?
1. Process oriented meetings of a) one on one, b) sub-team meetings, c) operational reviews
2. Mission oriented meeetings

# Process-oriented meetings
A regularly scheduled affair held to exchange knowledge and information

## One on Ones
- one on one: meeting between a supervisor and a subordinate. It is the principal way their business relationship is maintained. (72)
	- Its main purpose is mutual teaching and exchanging of information.
	- By talking about specific problems and situations, the supervisor teaches the subordinate their skills and know-how, and suggests ways to approach things.
	- At the same time, the subordinate provides the supervisor with detailed information about what they are doing and what they are concerned about.
	- There is an enormous difference between a casual encounter by a supervisor and subordinate, or even a meeting (mission-oriented) to resolve a specific problem, and a one-on-one

Questions about one on ones (73-78)
- Who should have a one-on-one? ...
- How often should you have one-on-ones? ...
- How long should a one-on-one meeting last? ...
- Where should a one-on-one take place? ...
- What should be covered in a one-on-one? ...
- What is the role of the supervisor in a one-on-one? ...
- What is the leverage of the one-on-one? 
	- Let's say you have a one-on-one with your subordinate every two weeks, and it lasts one and a half hours. 90 minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate's work for two weeks, or for some eighty-plus hours, and also upgrade your understanding of what he's doing. 
	- **This happens through the development of a common base of information and similar ways of doing and handling things between the supervisor and subordinate. And this, as noted, is the only way in which efficient and effective delegation takes place.**
	- At the same time, the subordinate teaches the supervisor, and what is learned is absolutely essential if the supervisor is to make good decisions.
	- 

"Mechanical hints for effective one-on-one meetings" (75)
- First, both the supervisor and subordinate should have a copy of the outline and both should take notes on it, which serves a number of purposes.
	- ...
- A real time-saver is using a "hold" file where both the supervisor and subordinate accumulate important but not altogether urgent issues for discussion at the next meeting.
	- This kind of file applies the production principle of batching and saves time for both involved by minimizing the need for ad hoc contact - like phone calls, drop-in visits, and so on - which constitute the interruptions we considered earlier
- The supervisor should also encourage the discussion of heart-to-heart issues because this is the perfect forum for getting at subtle and deep work-related problems affecting his subordinate.
	- Is he satisfied with his own performance? 
	- Does some frustration or obstacle gnaw at him?
	- Does he have doubts about where he is going?
	- The supervisor should be wary of the "zinger", which is a heart-to-heart issue brought up at an awkward time. More often than not, these come near the end of a meeting. If you let that happen, the subordinate might tell you something like he's unhappy and has been looking outside for a job and give you only five minutes to deal with it.
- **[Remote meetings] work well enough with proper preparation and attention: the supervisor must have the outline before the meeting begins, both parties should take notes, and so on. Because you can't see the other participant in the meeting, note-taking can't work in the same way as in a face-to-face meeting. Exchanging notes after the meeting is a way to make sure each knows what the other committed themself to.**
- One-on-ones should be schedule on a rolling basis - setting up the next one as the meeting taking place ends. Other commitments can thereby be taken into account and cancellations avoided. (or, make sure next recurring meeting is not conflicting at end of every 1-1)

## Staff Meetings
- staff meeting: one in which a supervisor and all of his subordinates participate, and which therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers. 
- ...

## Mission-oriented meetings

Unlike a process-oriented meeting, the mission-oriented meeting is usually held >> ad hoc. It is designed to produce a specific output, frequently a decision.

- problem solving. 5 Why's
- decision making
