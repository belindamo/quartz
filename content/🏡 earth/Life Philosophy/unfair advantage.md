### book quote
```
A good general rule of thumb is that you need at least 6 to 18 months of runway time if you’re going to quit a full-time job and focus on a startup. So, to decide whether Money is your particular unfair advantage, ask yourself:

- Do I have that capital in my bank accounts now (whether current, savings or ISAs)?
- Do I have friends and family who might invest that money upfront?
- Can I save that money doing my current job?

The main thing to consider if you don’t have the unfair advantage of Money is to build a business that doesn’t have a high startup cost, and doesn’t need to burn much money before it becomes profitable. In other words, get paying customers fast. Let that be your first priority. This can be thought of as a ‘lifestyle startup’. These are startups that don’t need to burn much money, and are profitable much sooner than ‘hyper-growth startups’, which are Silicon Valley-style startups aiming to become worth over $1 billion. Their strategy to get there is through hyper-growth, without much focus on profitability. There’s more information on choosing the type of startup that you want in Part Three.

The only exception to this is if you have the ability and credibility to raise funding from just the idea stage. This is quite rare ‒ usually you need good traction and momentum in your startup to be able to raise funding. You have to have a lot of the other unfair advantages in the MILES Framework – ideally a previous successful startup – to be able to pull it off. But it’s totally possible.

Here are just a few other suggestions, some of which focus on the most monetisable skills, others which look at ways of increasing your income:

Minimise living expenses We all do this: we buy stuff we don’t need. Cut down on this – that stuff probably isn’t making you happier and you might be spending all that money to impress people who don’t even care about you. By setting yourself a budget, saving money and being thriftier, you can extend your runway times and give yourself more time to become profitable or raise funding.

Learn marketing and sales If you study and apply marketing and sales, you will acquire a skill that is perpetually monetisable – there are always plenty of business owners whom you can help get more customers. You’ll be creating value, and will be recompensed accordingly. This is a business idea that is always valid, and is what Hasan did on a small scale, and what Gary Vaynerchuk is doing on a large scale with his marketing agency VaynerMedia. This is a way to get paying customers fast – you’re offering them a service. Even more importantly, you can apply marketing and sales techniques to your own startup to start generating revenue.

Raise funding By learning to pitch and having a good team and idea (a powerful insight into a problem and a strong solution), you can raise funding from investors. This is the least desirable option in some cases, because investors often become like your boss, and they take big chunks of your business, but for some people with the right hyper-growth startup idea and the right Expertise and Status, it’s a fantastic way to go. Virtually all the big success stories got there through funding. There is more about funding in Part Three.

Learn to code There are plenty of free and affordable books, courses and information on how to code. Not only does knowing how to code mean you can create your own product for your own startup with very little cost, but coding is very well paid, and you can freelance or get a full-time job doing it. This is a great way to make money to build yourself a runway.

Freelance By learning an in-demand skill, whether that be sales and marketing or coding, as we already mentioned, or anything like UX design, content writing or social media management, you’ll be able to make money in your spare time to supplement your full-time job or even as a career in and of itself. As you freelance your way to building your capital, your startup will be your side-hustle – until, one day, you can focus full time on your startup.

"financial constraints can breed creativity, resourcefulness and ingenuity, while having excessive amounts can breed more wasteful behaviour and lead to a startup’s downfall."



daddy paying for my masters is basically like $100k more investment in me. 
"That’s the great thing about wealth: it’s a safety net in case anything goes wrong. It’s a powerful contingency. That’s how privileged entrepreneurs can manage risk. They have a big fat safety net of money to fall on."
it's my safety net to take a fuck ton of risk....maybe i take full advantage of this unfair advantage. fuck it why not.

# 3. Intelligence and insight

- Booksmart
	- You probably already have a feeling of whether or not you’re ‘book smart’ based purely on how well you did at school and in exams. Those test how good you are at absorbing large amounts of information.
	- Good for
		- absorbing vast amts of info. knowledge frameworks to apply, like programming, etc.
		- getting degrees that look impressive
- Street smarts / people skills
- Creative intelligence
- Insight: something not a lot of people know about and that is really valuable/essential


```
Inspo: Patrick Collison created a unique coding language called Croma, that helped him and john build their first company, and they both became millionaires from this startup while they were still teenagers.
```

# 4. Location & Luck

- location: places with Access to all kinds of capital
	- in person
	- Online communities / chats too

# 5. Education & Expertise

# Misc. 


"Having a lot of money is an unfair advantage. Being able to fund your own startup is an unfair advantage. Not having the pressure of living payslip to payslip just to pay the rent and the bills is huge in terms of giving you the time to get your startup profitable (or to get the next round of funding for hyper-growth startups, which often take a long time to become profitable)."


**On Vision** 
People will follow a leader with vision, even if that vision turns out, in the end, to be a poor one. The person with vision serves as a prophet, voicing the unknown and bringing it into reality. If you are not able to imagine the future with your organisation, there is really little reason to continue moving forward. One setback, and you’re done.



MILES
 
- Mindset of gratitude
- also, high neurotiicism. le's figure out how to lower that shit. 
- A reality-growth mindset is the ability to accept the hard limits of the way things are (like the physical laws of the universe) and also to believe that anything is possible (the metaphysical way of looking at the universe).

- high openness: hard to say no to things


Unfair advantages exist. Talent exists. Luck exists. Sexism, ageism, nepotism, prejudice, social connections, inherited money, better educations ‒ these are all irrefutable truths. By and large, you are born into an extravaganza of fixed variables that you do not control. You must accept this. At the same time, you also must believe you are the master of your own future. You can take responsibility for the outcomes in your life. You can achieve virtually anything you set your mind to, as long as what you set your mind to is within the realms of possibility for you, based on your strengths and assets (your unfair advantages).

This precise duality of thinking is necessary.

Lean too far towards the unfairness of life, and you become a victim. 

Lean too far into the ‘fully-in- control master and architect of your future’ side, and you become disillusioned when your millionaire status doesn’t appear after a couple of years of hustle.


# what's my why
 "Why are you striving to achieve what you want to achieve? Why become a startup founder and entrepreneur in the first place?" "At the core of your actions (whether you are aware of it or not) is a deeper belief and sense of purpose guiding the choices you make. Your ‘why’ can change over time based on the experiences you have, but as human beings, when it comes down to it, we’re usually driven by just a few core motivations. As you embark on your startup journey, or any project that you undertake, ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing, and why you have set yourself such a goal.:" "Due to the arbitrary and unequal distribution of unfair advantages, your ‘why’ is particularly important in terms of how you define success for yourself. Ideally, your ‘why’ must come from you alone, because if it is driven by other people’s expectations, or a need for approval from others, suffering will be the outcome even if you succeed. Asking yourself that question will help you determine your real motivations for striving to achieve what you want to achieve."
