# seduction
"A seducer does not turn the power off and on—every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction"

- choose 1 of the types
- choose 2nd or 3rd when ready
- root out anti-seductive qualities


the 9 types in seduction >> siren, rake, ideal lover, dandy, natural, coquette, charmer, charismatic, star

- Siren
	- voice - an insinuating voice that hints at the erotic, more often subliminally than overtly. y. The Siren never speaks quickly, aggressively, or at a high pitch. Her voice is calm and unhurried, as if she had never quite woken up—or left her bed.
	- body
	- movement/demeanour
	- eyes
	- sexual energy
	- "First and foremost, **a Siren must distinguish herself from other women**. She is by nature a rare thing, mythic, only one to a group; she is also a valuable prize to be wrested away from other men. Cleopatra made herself different through her sense of high drama; the Empress Josephine Bonaparte's device was her extreme languorousness; Marilyn Monroe's was her littlegirl quality. Physicality offers the best opportunities here, since a Siren is preeminently a sight to behold. A highly feminine and sexual presence, even to the point of caricature, will quickly differentiate you, since most women lack the confidence to project such an image. Once the Siren has made herself stand out from others, she must have two other critical qualities: **the ability to get the male to pursue her so feverishly that he loses control**; and **a touch of the dangerous**. Danger is surprisingly seductive. To get the male to pursue you is relatively simple: a highly sexual presence will do this quite well. But you must not resemble a courtesan or whore, whom the male may pursue only to quickly lose interest in her. Instead, you are slightly elusive and distant, a fantasy come to life. During the Renaissance, the great Sirens, such as Tullia d'Aragona, would act and look like Grecian goddesses—the fantasy of the day. Today you might model yourself on a film goddess—anything that seems larger than life, even awe inspiring. These qualities will make a man chase you vehemently, and the more he chases, the more he will feel that he is acting on his own initiative. This is an excellent way of disguising how deeply you are manipulating him
		- An element of fear is also critical: keeping a man at a proper distance creates respect, so that he doesn't get close enough to see through you or notice your weaker qualities. Create such fear by suddenly changing your moods, keeping the man off balance, occasionally intimidating him with capricious behavior
- rake
- the ideal lover
- **dandy**
	- In adapting the Dandy character for your own purposes, remember that the Dandy is by nature a rare and beautiful flower. Be different in ways that are both striking and aesthetic, never vulgar; poke fun at current trends and styles, go in a novel direction, and be supremely uninterested in what anyone else is doing. Most people are insecure; they will wonder what you are up to, and slowly they will come to admire and imitate you, because you express yourself with total confidence
	- But a Dandy's style cannot be obvious, for Dandies are subtle, and never try hard for attention—attention comes to them. The person whose clothes are flagrantly different has little imagination or taste. Dandies show their difference in the little touches that mark a disdain for convention
	- Having people imitate you, of course, is a sign of your powers of seduction
	- "This is not an attitude you should impose on those around you—you can't make yourself a nuisance— but if you simply seem socially confident and sure of your taste, people will be drawn to you"
	- Dandies are supremely impudent. They don't give a damn about other people, and never try to please.
		- The insolence of the Rake is tied up with his desire to conquer a woman; he cares for nothing else. The insolence of the Dandy, on the other hand, is aimed at society and its conventions.
	- Men do not understand how women think, and vice versa; each tries to make the other act more like a member of their own sex. Dandies may never try to please, but in this one area they have a pleasing effect: by adopting psychological traits of the opposite sex, they appeal to our inherent narcissism
	- Do not be misled by the surface disapproval your Dandy pose may elicit. Society may publicize its distrust of androgyny (in Christian theology, Satan is often represented as androgynous), but this conceals its fascination; what is most seductive is often what is most repressed. Learn a playful dandyism and you will become the magnet for people's dark, unrealized yearnings
	- The key to such power is ambiguity. In a society where the roles everyone plays are obvious, the refusal to conform to any standard will excite interest. Be both masculine and feminine, impudent and charming, subtle and outrageous. Let other people worry about being socially acceptable; those types are a dime a dozen, and you are after a power greater than they can imagine.
	- A true Dandy knows the difference between a theatrically staged teasing of the powerful and a remark that will truly hurt, offend, or insult. It is particularly important to avoid insulting those in a position to injure you.
	- Symbol: The Orchid. Its shape and color oddly suggest both sexes, its odor is sweet and decadent —it is a tropical flower of evil. Delicate and highly cultivated, it is prized for its rarity; it is unlike any other flower
	- dangers: 
		- your same sex won't think so fondly of you
		- insolence has its limits

dandy >> rare and beautiful gender ambiguity. dangerous, impudent, toying the lines.

dandy dangers >> same sex generally doesn't think as fondly of you; being too insolent

- **Natural**
	- Natural seducers are people who somehow avoided getting certain childish traits drummed out of them by adult experience.
	- Because adult life is full of boredom and compromise, we harbor an illusion of childhood as a kind of golden age, even though it can often be a period of great confusion and pain
	- ppl spoil you
		- spoiled children have an undeservedly bad reputation: while those who are spoiled with material things are indeed often insufferable, those who are spoiled with affection know themselves to be deeply seductive. This becomes a distinct advantage when they grow up. According to Freud (who was speaking from experience, since he was his mother's darling), spoiled children have a confidence that stays with them all their lives. This quality radiates outward, drawing others to them, and, in a circular process, making people spoil them still more. Since their spirit and natural energy were never tamed by a disciplining parent, as adults they are adventurous and bold, and often impish or brazen
	- **Remember: the role you were given in life is not the role you have to accept. You can always live out a role of your own creation, a role that fits your fantasy. Learn to play with your image, never taking it too seriously**
		- The key is to infuse your play with the conviction and feeling of a child, making it seem natural. The more absorbed you seem in your own joy-filled world, the more seductive you become. Do not go halfway: make the fantasy you inhabit as radical and exotic as possible, and you will attract attention like a magnet
	- dangers - too much childishness; age

natural seducers >> people who somehow avoided getting certain childish traits drummed out of them by adult experience.

dangers of natural seducers >> too much childishness, aging gracefully

- coquette
	- teases
	- the real essence of Coquettes is in fact their ability to trap people emotionally, and to keep their victims in their clutches long after that first titillation of desire.
	- Masters of selective withdrawal, they hint at coldness, absenting themselves at times to keep their victim off balance, surprised, intrigued. Their withdrawals make them mysterious, and we build them up in our imaginations. (Familiarity, on the other hand, undermines what we have built.)
	- Today, coquetry is genderless. In a world that discourages direct confrontation, teasing, coldness, and selective aloofness are a form of indirect power that brilliantly disguises its own aggression.
	- All of the tactics of the Coquette have been adapted by political leaders to make the public fall in love. While exciting the masses, these leaders remain inwardly detached, which keeps them in control. After exciting the masses with a rousing speech, Mao Zedong would disappear from sight for days on end, making himself an object of cultish worship
- charmer
	- seduction without sex
	- danger: some immune
- **charismatic**
	- What made the Hebrews believe in Moses, follow him out of Egypt, and remain loyal to him despite their endless wandering in the desert? The look in his eye, his inspired and inspiring words, the face that literally glowed when he came down from Mount Sinai—all these things gave him the appearance of having direct communication with God, and were the source of his authority. And these were what was meant by "charisma," a Greek word referring to prophets and to Christ himself
	- Their charisma is mysterious and inexplicable, never obvious. They have an unusual confidence. They have a gift—often a smoothness with language— that makes them stand out from the crowd. They express a vision. We may not realize it, but in their presence we have a kind of religious experience: we believe in these people, without having any rational evidence for doing so. When trying to concoct an effect of charisma, never forget the religious source of its power. You must radiate an inward quality that has a saintly or spiritual edge to it. Your eyes must glow with the fire of a prophet. Your charisma must seem natural, as if it came from something mysteriously beyond your control, a gift of the gods. In our rational, disenchanted world, people crave a religious experience, particularly on a group level. Any sign of charisma plays to this desire to believe in something. And there is nothing more seductive than giving people something to believe in and follow
	- Saintliness. Most of us must compromise constantly to survive; saints do not. They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences. The saintly effect bestows charisma. 
		- Saintliness goes far beyond religion: politicians as disparate as George Washington and Lenin won saintly reputations by living simply, despite their power—by matching their political values to their personal lives. Both men were virtually deified after they died. Albert Einstein too had a saintly aura—childlike, unwilling to compromise, lost in his own world. 
		- The key is that you must already have some deeply held values; that part cannot be faked, at least not without risking accusations of charlatanry that will destroy your charisma in the long run. The next step is to show, as simply and subtly as possible, that you live what you believe
- star
	- First, you must have such a large presence that you can fill your target's mind the way a close-up fills the screen. You must have a style or presence that makes you stand out from everyone else. Be vague and dreamlike, yet not distant or absent—you don't want people to be unable to focus on or remember you. They have to be seeing you in their minds when you're not there.
	- Second, cultivate a blank, mysterious face, the center that radiates Starness. This allows people to read into you whatever they want to, imagining they can see your character, even your soul. Instead of signaling moods and emotions, instead of emoting or overemoting, the Star draws in interpretations. That is the obsessive power in the face of Garbo or Dietrich, or even of Kennedy, who molded his expressions on James Dean's
- anti-seducer
	- Anti-Seducers, however, are insecure to such a degree that they cannot be drawn into the seductive process. Their needs, their anxieties, their self-consciousness close them off. They interpret the slightest ambiguity on your part as a slight to their ego; they see the merest hint of withdrawal as a betrayal, and are likely to complain bitterly about it.
	- You must look for clues to their self-involvement and insecurity: 
		- perhaps they are ungenerous, or they argue with unusual tenacity, or are excessively judgmental. 
		- Perhaps they lavish you with undeserved praise, declaring their love before knowing anything about you. 
		- Or, most important, they pay no attention to details. Since they cannot see what makes you different, they cannot surprise you with nuanced attention
	- There is nothing more anti-seductive than feeling that someone has assumed that you are theirs, that you cannot possibly resist them. The slightest ap- pearance of this kind of conceit is deadly to seduction; you must prove yourself, take your time, win your target's heart.
	- types
		- brute
		- suffocator
		- moralizer
		- tightwad
		- bumbler
		- windbag
		- reactor
		- vulgarian
	- avoid being a bumbler! being too self conscious
	- tact, style, attention to detail
	- In a world of few formalities and ceremony, seduction is one of the few remnants from the past that retains the ancient patterns. It is a ritual, and its rites must be observed. Haste reveals not the depth of your feelings but the degree of your self-absorption
	- Excessive pride, without anything to justify it, is highly anti-seductive.
	- The person who is obviously angling for money or other material reward can only repel. If that is your intention, **if you are looking for something other than pleasure—for money, for power—never show it**. The suspicion of an ulterior motive is anti-seductive. Never let anything break the illusion

Wordless communication (through clothes, gestures, actions) is the most pleasurable, exciting, and seductive form of language.


Remember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly filling the other person's mind with your presence. Distance and inattention will create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need arises

if you really want to "anti-seduce," simply feign the qualities listed at the beginning of the chapter. Nag; talk a lot, particularly about yourself; dress against the other person's tastes; pay no attention to detail; suffocate, and so on.


- victims are categorized by what they feel they are missing in life—adventure, attention, romance, a naughty experience, mental or physical stimulation, etc. Once you identify their type, you have the necessary ingredients for a seduction: you will be the one to give them what they lack and cannot get on their own. In studying potential victims, learn to see the reality behind the appearance. A timid person may yearn to play the star; a prude may long for a transgressive thrill. Never try to seduce your own type

# 48 laws
The writer (RG) himself said: If someone reads and follows all the 48 laws, that person would be the most ugly and disgusting one to ever walked the planet.

?
never outshine the master

3rd law 
?
conceal your intentions

4th law
?

# mastery

*You are born with a particular makeup and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature. If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become - an individual, a Master.*

1. life's task
2. apprenticeship
5. creative-active phase
6. mastery: intuitive + rational

"Many of the greatest Masters in history have confessed to experiencing some kind of force or voice or sense of destiny that has guided them forward"
vocation: to call or be called
what is my personal legend?
inner direction/radar...
what is my destiny from birth?
at all costs avoid breaking contact with my destiny


**The process of following your Life's Task al the way to mastery can essentially begin at any point in life. The hidden force within you is always there and ready to be engaged.**

 **The road to mastery requires patience. You will have to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road, when you will reap the rewards of your efforts.** The process of getting there, however, is full of challenges and pleasures. Make your return to the path a resolution you set for yourself,
and then tell others about it.

## Life's task
### primary obstacles
- voice of others infecting you
- fight over limited resources
- false paths
- getting stuck in the past
- losing your way

### 5 Strategies
1. return to your origins - your primal inclinations
2. occupy the perfect niche - darwinian style. choose rough field that corresponds with interests. after mastering field 1, either move into narrower field or expand to other fields. until niche is found
3. avoid the false path - discovering the false paths that we sought for money, fame, attention...not our deepest desires
4. let go of the past - figure out how to make the path work for you.
5. find your way back - life or death strategy.

#### what to do when lost...

When you are faced with deficiencies instead of strengths and inclinations, this is the strategy you must assume: ignore your weaknesses and resist the temptation to be more like others. Instead, like Temple Grandin, direct yourself toward the small things you are good at. Do not dream or make grand plans for the future, but instead concentrate on becoming proficient at these simple and immediate skills. This will bring you confidence and become a base from which you can expand to other pursuits. Proceeding in this way, step by step, you will hit upon your Life's Task.

**Understand: Your Life's Task does not always appear to you through some grand or promising inclination. It can appear in the guise of your deficiencies, making you focus on the one or two things that you are inevitably good at. Working at these skills, you learn the value of discipline and see the rewards you get from your efforts. Like a lotus flower, your skills will expand outward from a center of strength and confidence.**

## apprentice
Every time you change careers or acquire new skills, you reenter this phase of life - the Apprenticeship.

*The dangers are many. fI you are not careful, you will succumb to insecurities, become embroiled in emotional issues and conflicts that wil dominate your thoughts; you will develop fears and learning disabilities that you will carry with you throughout your life. Before it is too late you must learn the lessons and follow the path established by the greatest Masters, past and present-a kind of Ideal Apprenticeship that transcends all fields. In the process you will master the necessary
skills, discipline your mind, and transform yourself into an independent thinker, pre- pared for the creative challenges on the way to mastery.*

*Zora Neale Hurston's story reveals in its barest form the reality of the Apprenticeship Phase-no one is really going to help you or give you direction.*

 the goal of an apprenticeship is not money, a good position, a title, or a diploma, but rather the transformation of your mind and character-the first transformation on the way to mastery.
### 3 steps
- deep observation (passive mode)
	- still the ego and look outward instead of inward
- skills acquisition (practice mode)
	- simple and essential skills
	- begin with 1 skill that you can master, that servers as a foundation for acquiring others. Avoid at all costs managing to learn several skills at a time
	- "It is better to dedicate two or three hours of intense focus to a skill than to spend eight hours of diffused concentration on it."
- experimentation (active mode)
	- actively experiment with the skills learned. initiate project, do work that may expose to criticism
	- You will know when your apprenticeship is over by the feeling that you have nothing left to learn in this environment.


1. Value learning over money "You must never disdain an apprenticeship with no pay. In fact, it is often the height of wisdom to find the perfect mentor and offer your services as an assistant for free."
2. 





What separates Masters from others si often something surprisingly simple. Whenever we learn askill, we frequently reach apoint of frustration-what we are learning seems beyond our capabilities. Giving ni to these feelings, we unconsciously quit on ourselves before we actually give up.

When it comes to mastering a skill, time is the magic ingredient. 



When a machine malfunctions you do not take it personally or grow
despondent. It is in fact a blessing in disguise. Such malfunctions generally show you inherent flaws and means of improvement. You simply keep tinkering until you get ti right. The same should apply ot an entrepreneurial venture. Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies.

# my notes

- I'm learning that most of the greats had apprenticeships that were...not a 1:1 relationship with someone they could learn from. Rather, the apprenticeship was curated, and varying widely based on the topic. They typically receive feedback from a variety of people. The feedback could be for a specific project/idea, but it could also be indirectly from work experience. Still others barely received feedback, like John Keats writing his poems. Still others had their apprenticeship in the form of fucking around and finding out, like Henry Ford who had 3 tries before landing on his successful car business.  And others enrolled in school to receive formal training.


*Understand: we live in the world of a sad separation that began some five hundred years ago when art and science split apart. Scientists and technicians live in their own world, focusing mostly on the "how" of things. Others live in the world of appearances, using these things but not really understanding how they function. Just before this split occurred, it was the ideal of the Renaissance to combine these two forms of knowledge.*

### how much time to spend to get to a groundbreaking thing?

how much time to spend to get to the ground breaking thing?
?
short answer is 10 years.
In the case of Mozart, it is generally agreed among classical music critics that he did not write an original and substantial piece of music until well after ten years of composing. In fact, a study of some seventy great classical composers determined that with only three exceptions, all of the composers had needed at least ten years to produce their first great work, and the exceptions had somehow managed to create theirs in nine years. 
Einstein began his serious thought experiments at the age of sixteen. Ten years later he came up with his first revolutionary theory of relativity. It is impossible to quantify the time he spent honing his theoretical skills in those ten years, but is not hard to imagine him working three hours a day on this particular problem, which would yield more than 10,000 hours after a decade.

## Absorb the mentor's power: Mentor dynamic

*The right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience become yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, os you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to-person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit. Choose the mentor who best fits your needs and connects ot your Lifes' Task. Once you have internalized their knowledge, you must move on and never remain
ni their shadow. Your goal is always to
surpass your mentors in mastery and brilliance.*
