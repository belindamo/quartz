What is existential kink theory? >> get off on the "ugliness" of certain parts of self/environment. allows for full acceptance of those parts of self

# Notes

- Getting off on ‚Äúthe ugliness‚Äù
	- Then leads in some ways to no longer find it ugly but adorable, funny part of the whole. Then truly allow yourself to feel, receive, get off on how wonderful life already is ü•∞
- Most of us are actually very committed to dodging the most intense pleasurable sensations of life - intimacy, creative inspiration, being valued with time and money, being desired 
	- In order to dodge feeling these intense, wonderful sensations, we turn ourselves off, mainly by using worry, doubt, criticism, complaint, resentment, and upsets.
- Try to adopt an aesthetic rather than a moral attitude to your feeling states


In my own words‚Ä¶.

Craving is craving

- Craving and aversion can be deeply joyful. Learn to bring them to awareness and deeply experience the joy of being bad
	- With this, then I can learn to identify them when they come up again, and choose either to be bad at that point or to redirect the energy elsewhere towards more aligned actions
- I do believe I get what I deeply desire but sometimes what I deeply desire is unpleasant, painful, secret, repressed, fucked up shit
