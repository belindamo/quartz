According to Vimalaramsi, a short, clear, and precise definition of Mindfulness as the Buddha taught it is: 
?
Mindfulness means to remember to observe
how mind’s attention moves 
from one thing to another.

---
the Buddha discussed the Mindfulness of Mettā practice many more times in the suttas than the Mindfulness of Breathing (Ānāpānasati) practice: eight times for Mindfulness of Breathing and over a hundred times for the Mindfulness of Lovingkindness

---

Buddha taught that the key to understanding Craving and distractions is to realize that
?
**mind and body are one process that cannot be separated.**
Tension and tightness are bodily processes, while thought and images are mental processes.

The Buddha talked about four divine qualities of mind that are particularly wholesome. They are called the Brahmavihāras and consist of:
?
- Lovingkindness (Mettā)
- Compassion (karuṇā)
- Sympathetic Joy (muditā)—we actually prefer just Joy
- Equanimity (upekkhā).
The Buddha taught that when the meditation is properly practiced, all four divine states arise on their own one after the other. 12 You will learn how to radiate any of these four states to all the six directions and then to all directions at the same time. 

As this happens, the jhānas will arise naturally on their own as well. The word jhāna is a loaded word. It has been translated in many different ways, but we refer to the jhānas as levels of understanding.

jhānas (in TWIM by Vamalaramsi) >> levels of understanding


We call the jhānic states that we experience with this meditation the Tranquil Aware Jhānas. There are eight of them (four rūpa or “material” jhānas, and four arūpa or “immaterial” jhānas). Beyond the highest immaterial jhāna lies the experience of Nibbāna itself. Your mind will become so quiet that it just stops. When the mind comes back from that cessation experience, it will be incredibly bright and clear, with no disturbance—like a blackboard with nothing on it.

At that point, when the next mental process arises, you will see with astonishing clarity every link and part of this process that we call life as it arises and passes away. This process is what the Buddha called Dependent Origination. There are twelve links in each moment of experience, and you will see how all of these arise and pass away. You will see how all of these dependently arise one upon the other. 


When you see very deeply into this process, you will understand, on a profound personal level, that all of the “aggregates” that make up “you,” or the “I,” are impersonal and without any enduring self or soul. This experience is so profound that Nibbāna will arise, and you will understand the true nature of all existence. You will have attained awakening in this very life — there will be so much relief! 

Experiencing awakening (Nibbāna) happens for many people who follow these simple directions. It does not take years or decades. The Buddha said that this practice is “immediately effective.” In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, he says that this experience can take place in as little as seven years, or even seven days. It can truly happen that fast; we have seen it take place within a single eight-day retreat. So, start now, and you too can experience the initial stages of awakening. Just follow the instructions exactly!

5 hindrances
?
1. greed, sensual desires
2. hatred, aversion
3. sloth (laziness/sleepiness) and torpor (dullness)
4. restlessness, worry, anxiety
5. doubt (in yourself, the teacher, the practice, the Buddha)


How might we treat the hindrances?
?
Make the hindrances my friends. 
They are my teachers who show me where I am attached.

- love to self
- love to friend
- love to others
- mantra
- smile


- 6 Rs (or right effort)

- sit
- walk

- candle

one way
1. Sit for a minimum of thirty minutes (why is explained later).
2. Begin by radiating kind and happy thoughts and wishes to yourself for about ten minutes. 
3. Switch to your one chosen Spiritual Friend for the remainder of your sitting—at least twenty minutes—and radiate kind and happy thoughts to them for the rest of the session. Stay with just the same Friend and do not switch to anything or anyone else, even if you think they “deserve” your attention. Such desires are just more distractions. The mind can be very sneaky! 
4. Use the 6Rs to overcome distractions.
