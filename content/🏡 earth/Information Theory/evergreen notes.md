[1] This criteria is different from Matuschak's because he suggests writing solely for the self. I prefer shortcutting the process so that evergreen notes are both for myself and for others given that it is written simply. 


### Notes

Notes should be
- A - atomic - bite sized about one thing
- C - concept oriented - as opposed to author / subject
- D - densely linked - with preference for links embedded throughout the note 
- E - even handed - written simply in a way that any English speaker with 5th grade reading level will get instantly, barring linked words. [1]
- A - associative - rather than hierarchical 

Explore each note as a [unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be) because it helps insight, comprehension, and writing [accrete](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6UDDkom8Aifg6mLdjT1sPtbMBweCmpyTwmJT) over time. 

### Using evergreen notes in practice
- write about what I read to comprehend and retain more effectively 
- incorporate a reading inbox
- incorporate a writing inbox
- have a strategy for writing, whether directed or undirected 



### Ideas

Inspiration:
What Bode was saying was this: “Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.” Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works 10% more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest. I don’t want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime.
