#concept

map of content (MOC) [[SR/memory/VRvzL0uu.md|>>]] a note that maps the contents of some of your notes.


In my opinion, MOC is a bit of a useless term since every note maps the contents of your notes. It is hard to quantify and differentiate between an MOC note and a normal note. My implementation (as of Sep 1, 2024) is to have #concept and #concept-pamphlet  instead, to differentiate between atomic notes and more complex notes.

### Notes

Every note can be a MOC.
A note may be stretched in 4 directions: where did it come from, where will it lead to, what are similar notes, what are different notes
