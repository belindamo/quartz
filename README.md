# 🧚🏼‍♀️ Belinda's Writings

How these writings are organized:
- `content` folder contains writings. 
- Releases tab has larger writing milestones.
- Commits occur upon every sync

This is built on top of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which helps me open source my writing commits and easily deploy them with a pretty website. The content syncs with my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) notes! ❤️
